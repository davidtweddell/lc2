Lung volumes measured by plethysmography are within normal limits. The airways resistance, measured during quiet breathing at resting lung volume and adjusted for the lung volume, is within normal limits. DLCO is within normal limits. However, the result has not been adjusted to the patient's hemoglobin level, which could influence the measured value. The presence of reactive airway disease cannot be confirmed or refuted by today's test results. If the clinical suspicion for it is high, then a methacholine bronchoprovocation test might help disclose it.

It has a large spectrum of disease and there is not one medication/ intervention that can be done for all at this point. However, our LC&LIRP will work with her to hopefully support her and with the goal to get her feeling better. Discussed that my approach At this time includes symptom management and to rule out any other possible etiology contributing to the symptoms one is experiencing. Of which I think she has been referred and hooked into care appropriately. I encourage her to f/u with her specialty care as she has been. Will send message to Long Covid to help get her hooked into continuing care.

Says she had COVID December 2020 (was not yet vaccinated at the time). Recalls being acutely ill for about 1 month. Was sick enough that family suggested going to the hospital but she declined, and was able to treat adequately at home. Recovered partially but never felt back to pre-COVID baseline. Symptoms are predominantly chest-related. - Gets winded easily, particularly with walking and with wearing a mask. Says she is able to walk, just gets symptomatic with tightness in her chest. Has an albuterol inhaler which does help, typically needs it 2-3 times per day. No prior diagnosis of asthma and no breathing problems prior to COVID illness. Does not have an oximeter. Was never on supplemental oxygen during/after COVID illness. - Also gets palpitations and an abnormal sensation in her throat almost like throat is closing.

Today 8/19/22 she wtill symptomatic and very frustrated as she wants to be back to her usual state of health (active, focus, no pain or aches). Labs were ordered to r/o any metabolic disturbance although everything came back normal including CBC, TSH and CMP. Patient on exam does not have any pufinness over joints, there is no joint swelling, no fever, or new rash and no substantial weight loss, no oral ulcers. There is very low threshold to start a rheumatologic work-up at this time. Patient was advised to try some integrative medicine such as turmeric, vitamin D and Zinc. In regards her extension to her EDD disability she ust go directly with the first provider as these symptoms are related to the same condition. Will contact provider Goldfinger NP, as she might need to see pt firts in order for claim extension. Will contcat PASC if referral can be moved to sooner. Will follow-up in 3-4 weeks.

In her case, due to her arthralgias and fatigue, as well as being a young woman in her 30s, i think it is worthwhile for rheum evaluation to r/o any underlying autoimmune condition contributing to her symptoms. I also feel she could benefit from PT which we discussed and she is amendable to. we discussed in certain patients, a particular PT patient-tailored regimen is warranted due to the post exertional malaise one can experience. • Labs : ANA IFA SCREEN W/REFL TO TITER AND PATTERN, IFA [0000249] • Labs : UTILIZATION REVIEW REQUEST FOR LAB NOT IN SYSTEM [EC_TEST] • Labs : C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP) [TST4065] • Labs : SED RATE/ESR [00TST40] • Labs : Hemoglobin A1C [000078A] • Labs : RHEUMATOID FACTOR (RF) [0004418] • Consult : PHYSICAL THERAPY (VERIFY AUTH REQUIREMENT ) [Referral Valid until 04/21/2023] [Referral Valid until 04/21/2023] [Referral Valid until 04/21/2023] [Referral Valid until 04/21/2023] [Referral Valid until 04/21/2023] [Referral Valid until 04/21/2023] [Referral Valid until 04/21/2023] Consult, TREATMENT, EVALUATION, • Consult : RHEUMATOLOGY (VERIFY AUTH REQUIREMENT ) [Referral Valid until 04/21/2023] Consult, not interested in mental health services at this time. also discussed sleep study but as her insomnia has improved, would like to forgo that for now reviewed the 4 P's: prioritizing, pacing, planning and positioning all questions answered • Follow Up : Routine 1-2 Month(s) Addendum Addendum: Finalized: Coding Addendum : Diagnosis Coded for this visit R5383 - Other Fatigue M2550 - Pain In Unspecified Joint Z8616 - Personal History Of Covid-19 G9339 - Other Post Infection And Related Fatigue Syndromes Procedures Coded for this visit 99214 - office mod mdm, est 99214 - office mod mdm, est """

""" 2023-01-17 Concerns/health issues discussed: long covid initial initial covid illness - November 2020 - felt recovered after 3-4 months ago had a repeat infection - reports symptoms at that time included a 'big headache', fatigue (would have to sit after doing anything), body aches, loss of taste. she felt the first 3 days were the worse, and around day 6 she started to feel better. said she couldn't get in touch with her clinic which she feels in unfortunate because had seen there was treatment available. Over the past few months, still has some persistent symptoms including feeling like she is dehydrated with dry mouth. Also she still has some fatigue - ie. before would work 8 hours continuous (works in house keeping)or with house work, but now needs to take breaks. Her main current concern is she is worried something is seriously wrong. On her last labs she had slightly elevated bilirubin. The provider ordered a CT scan. When she followed up on the scan she was told her insurance was processing it but a few weeks after when she still hadn't heard anything was told in fact order hadn't been sent/ processed.

In her particular case, we will focus on her current workup as that is really causing a lot of stress on her. I will plan on follow up to monitor her for further long covid care as able. otherwise, i recommend symptomatic care. i.e. for her fatigue, to continue pacing herself as she has been doing and taking the breaks her body needs. lab work showed normal Hb, thyroid function kidney function, and a1c.

We discussed Post Covid Syndrome and how there is still so much we are learning and to be learned about this condition. It has a large spectrum of disease and there is not one medication/ intervention that can be done for all at this point. Part of the challenge with long covid is that we do not have a complete grasp on the pathophysiology of it.

Fully vaccinated for COVID with first booster in 2021. COVID symptoms started around 3/4/22, tested positive on 3/8/22, had mAb infusion on 3/9 with Sotrovimab. Acute symptoms improved but he has continued to experience brain fog and also fatigue and sometimes dizziness since infection. Pt with complex cardiac history and notes that he also started a new diuretic right around the same time he got COVID so recognizes that some of his symptoms could be side effects of the medication as well based on timing. Regarding brain fog, says he has a hard time concentrating, also forgets words, and finds that tasks requiring focus take much longer to complete. For example, he normally takes notes during his medical visits and then transfers them to a main file where he keeps track of everything; since getting COVID, this process takes him hours, whereas before it could be done in a relatively short amount of time. During conversation he finds he has a hard time thinking of words that normally would be very familiar to him (such as last night he couldn't think of the word """"stent,"""" though he has talked about medical procedures involving stents extensively in the past). Words will sometimes come to him hours or days later. Regarding fatigue, says he tries very easily with physical tasks. has mobility limitations even pre-COVID so some activities likely laundry and shopping are always hard/ However, now he can only wash a few dishes then has to sit and rest 5-10 minutes to regain the energy to go dry them. Energy level does improve after these periods of rest. Sleeping at his baseline which is """"awful,"""" gets up every couple hours to urinate which he attributes to diuretics and Flomax. Takes Bumex bid at 11am when he gets u and again at 11pm.

States she had acute COVID December 2020. Had just gotten first dose of the vaccine but thinks she was already exposed before getting vaccinated. Says she was pretty sick during initial infection but did not go to the hospital. Some acute sx resolved but fatigue and dyspnea never fully resolved. Dyspnea is the primary bothersome symptom - says it's hard to get a satisfying deep breath, hard to walk and carry things. Seems to be triggered by breathing cold air, even sleeping with the window open makes it worse. Sees pulmonology, says she was diagnosed with asthma but the diagnosis came after her initial COVID infection. Thinks she may have had some asthma sx before but much worse since illness. Per pulm notes on file 04/20/2021, """"PFTs show normal lung mechanics, volumes, and diffusion capacity,"""" and pt carries a diagnosis of mild intermittent bronchial asthma. Does not know the names of her inhalers. Says that the orange inhaler helps but makes her shaky, needs it daily. The green and yellow powder one helped but is not covered. Had an oximeter she bought when sick with COVID but can't find it. Appears O2 sat was 98% in clinic on 7/12.

Problems addressed this Visit : • Diarrhea of presumed infectious origin - 0093[I10: A09]. - Likely from food trigger as above, less concerning for bacterial infection. Patient afebrile today, VSS, unremarkable exam. - Rx for symptomatic relief - Can consider further workup if symptoms remain persistent • Post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC) - 1398[I10: U09.9]. Patient with multiple ED visits in the past month with unremarkable evaluation for syncope, currently being evaluated with Cardiology, recently referred to Neuro, now reporting he believes he will be now permanently disabled and will never recover from the yet undiagnosed ailment he is currently being evaluated for. Patient appears euthymic, discussed his feelings as to why he does not believe he will recover at length today, he declines mental health referral. Complication from his COVID infection may be possible, though seems less consistent as his initial infection was early 2020 and his episodes of syncope did not start until 4/2022. However, he does report 'fogginess', being easily fatigued when he was working. At first we discussed possible case coordination to assist in his workup, but in discussing other services at FHC, he would prefer referral to our PASC program. - Referral: PASC - Recommend patient continue evaluation with Cardiology and Neurology - f/u at scheduled appt on 6/14 Addendum Addendum: Finalized: Coding Addendum : Diagnosis Coded for this visit R112 - Nausea With Vomiting, Unspecified R197 - Diarrhea, Unspecified R5383 - Other Fatigue R55 - Syncope And Collapse Procedures Coded for this visit 99213 - office low mdm, est 2022-06-10 34 Yrs 11 Mo old Male with PMH significant for Asthma, h/o COVID who presents for follow up PASC, forms.

Although he does admit to morning fatigue he attributes to pushing himself with his daily exercises. I did discuss with him stopping short of becoming fatigued or short of breath as well as using his albuterol prior to exercise. Patient will try this and voiced understanding. He does not wish to undergo any further testing including a sleep study which may reveal poor sleep despite him getting at least 8 hours. -Orthostatic vital signs unremarkable and show appropriate response from laying to sitting to standing. Low suspicion for autonomic dysregulation at this time. We will continue to monitor -At this time, I agree with reinstating his driving privileges and he will return to work next month. His physical exam today was unremarkable and I see no restrictions to driving. I will recommend, though, the DMV administering the driving test again. He will provide the DMV paperwork as soon as he can at that point I will fill it out to the best of my ability and fax it to the number he provided.

Reports in December 2020 he had Covid-19. On Dec 5 he went to the ED as he said he felt so poor, but was discharged back home. Then a couple days later on the 7th went back due to feeling even worse and was admitted. Said he was admitted for 3 weeks and was close to intubation, but ultimately didn't need it. He remembers the doctors talking to him about needing intubation due to oxygen levels falling but he did not consent to it. They then asked him to sign the other paper since he said no to intubation and he also didn't want to sign that form. Said at that moment he felt he had a very spirtual moment and started to cry. After this, his oxygen levels started to increase and he did not need to be intubated. He said he did receive treatments (?steroids, remdesivir). He said even though he was there for several weeks, he never felt like he was going to die. Felt he was very cared for at that hospital and everyone who took care of him were 'angels.' Since then, he had several persistent/ new issues since his Covid illness: -feeling short of breath - has noted improvement, but still notices it when he meditates and tries to take deep breaths/ hold them in. initially couldn't walk 1 block, but now can do a lot more activity , i.e. can run for 40 minutes. -another recurring issue is a back/ lung pain that notices when twisting. says if he relaxes and takes some breaths the pain will go away. has seen a pulmonologist and was told he has some scaring of his lungs - so thinks maybe that is the sensation/ pain he notes at times. - trouble with word finding and also forgets why went places, i.e. go to storage unit and would forget why, so would go back and then remembers he was headed there to find pliers - random sensations that he says can last seconds but are as such: gets confused in shower ('loses his north'), moments feels floor shaking when it's note, feels like his insides are elevating . denies feeling outright dizzy during any of these episodes. and again are self-resolving after a matter of seconds Previously he said his sleep was quite poor, but that was because he would stay up and watch TV series. Now he makes it a point to sleep 7-8 hours a night and feels good and well rested with this change. does say this is contingent that he takes his sleeping pill to sleep, otherwise, he won't be able to. things that help him improve include exercises and stretching. Also started taking muscle support medication he bought at costco (can't remmeber what name). But previously said his muscles would feel sore like he ran a marathon and since taking he feels better. Also his spirituality/ medication had been a big help to his wellbeing and recovery. When I asked how he felt he is now compared to his precovid self he says he is """"100%"""" but then adds on with exception to the modifications he had mentioned as above. Feels he is doing ok as he has learned how to manage it. (translation of what he said in spanish: """"life is the same as before covid, but only with these details"""") Objective Vitals reviewed.

We discussed Post Covid Syndrome and how there is still so much we are learning and to be learned about this condition. It has a large spectrum of disease and there is not one medication/ intervention that can be done for all at this point. Part of the challenge with long covid is that we do not have a complete grasp on the pathophysiology of it. If we can better delineate that, our hope is that we can have a better idea on how to manage it all. At this time , a couple of the main staples in care includes symptom management and to rule out any other possible etiology contributing to the symptoms one is experiencing. He has had a good workup including cardiology and pulmonology evaluations. fortunately overall improved with time and he now has good exercise tolerance discussed PT/ pulmonary therapy, but he is not interested at this time as he has really been able to make adjustments and return to a good level of activity as he was at pre-covid. due to poor sleep without aide of melatonin, could consider evaluating for sleep apnea (stop bang questionnaire puts him in category for intermediate risk) as uncorrected sleep apnea could affect how one feels, including memory/cognition and cardiovascular health. he is agreeable • Consult: SLEEP STUDIES (VERIFY AUTH REQUIREMENT ) [Referral Valid until 09/29/2023] Consult, Polysomnogram with Poss.

This is a new patient for me. He is 55 yo male with apparent PASC after infection of COVID in 2020, then second infection starting in Jan. He has seen pulmonollogy and was given PFTs showing borderline restrictive defect. He was given Qvar + Proair prior. Has also been on tiny dose of b-blocker. He had severe COVID and was intubated and was in the hospital for about 3 months. That was while he was incarcerated. Was having some palpitations and given metoprolol for that. And an inhaler. CXR was done by us at intake showing Prominence of interstitial markings at the lung bases, left greater than right may represent scarring/fibrosis Cardiologist in Hillcrest seen but he doesn't recall whom (not in our chart) Pulmonologist seen once only (PFTs only) Currently experiencing DOE, can't work, can't do yard work, can't walk upstairs. Has PT intake on 3/18. Only CT was just after hospitalization. Got J&J but not boosted Denies headaches, loss of smell, but can feel fatigue but more is depression about it. The main issues at least by phone seem more breathing related. There's a long DC summary from Lompoc that I have not seen yet.

This was after being vaccinated. She has felt since then subjective dyspnea, and then gets fatigued easily, and some back pains and some chest pain if she exercises, headaches. She is getting step PT. Has helped a little bit, in that her dyspnea isn't as much like before. All of the symptoms are less not gone but have improved. She has been through the PT and has no f/u for that. Acute sore throat has improved. She also had a LN that comes and goes apparently was seen in 2021 for that was told to observe.

It's a challenge to decide if addl w/u is needed. the prior LN was ultrasounded and negative for mass. I will consider chest radiography and in person EKG at f/u as reasonable if clinically appropriate and get more of an idea if there are palpitations but sense is less that and more of the pulmonary pathway. 1.

I expressed understanding in her frustration and that she still does not feel well. discussed what PASC is and the variability of symptoms and duration. I also discussed that we do not have a particular treatment at this time for long-covid symptoms, but try to symptomatically help manage the patient. We also discussed that a lot of government money is going into research for this so we are hopeful to have more to offer in the near future. I also discussed, that despite her not feeling well, one thing that we have seen longitudinally, is people do note improvement with time. So although her index illness was more than a year ago and therefore a long time to still be feeling unwell, hopefully, in the coming months she will note a change. we also addressed mental health and how important that is to focus on and I encourage her strongly to continue care with our MH team. I also told her about survivor corps as a potential source of support and resources.

Per provider SOAP note 02/2022: had COVID 01/2022, complication of hypoexmia and pneumonia, treated in hospital with dexamethasone and remdesivir. Condition worsened, then treated with investigational drug baricitinib. Eventually discharged on supplemental oxygen. Has had chronic respiratory sx since then. Denies any other chronic issues following COVID illness, apart from respiratory sx. Says he was on oxygen, and had to be very sedentary for months after initial illness. Eventually returned to work in construction, says initially it was very difficult and he would get very short of breath. However over time he has improved, says he is about 90% better than when he left the hospital. Using oxygen just prn at home but not at work. Tolerating work, though sometimes needs rescue inhaler at work. After very hard labor he feels like burning inside and then uses oxygen at home which helps. Followed by pulmnology. Per last notes 2/21/23: seen for f/u long-COVID, continues to have DOE when walking up stairs or carrying something heavy (ok on flat ground), no longer requiring supplemental home O2; PFT 12/3/22 showed mild obstructive defect and moderate restrictive defect, mild decrease in diffusing capacity, insignificant response to bronchodilator; high-resolution CT showed chronic changes with right upper lobe mild airspace opacities with reticulations and bronchiectasis in b/l lower lobes; trial LABA maintenance inhaler (Serevent 50mcg 1 puff bid), continue albuterol prn, refer to pulmonary rehab; RTC 10/2023 for repeat chest CT and PFTs. - Says he was told f/u in 1 year. Has not heard anything about pulmonary rehab. Tried Serevent a couple times but didn't notice a difference so stopped it. Using albuterol prn, but not every day. Had sleep study 3/4/23 showing severe OSA with AHI 134.8 and nadir oxygen 64%. Says he received CPAP and has been using it as instructed. Former smoker, has quit completely.

Severe OSA and found to have both restrictive and obstructive defects on PFTs. Pulmonary rehab pending. Encouraged him to contact pulm office for an update on this - phone number provided. Explained the use of maintenance inhaler - unlikely to notice immediate relief, may need to use consistently a few weeks to see effect. Pt says he did not realize, would like to try it again, needs refill.

Since already under care of pulmonology, I am not sure there will be much for me to do to augment his PASC care. However, will check in periodically to make sure he is getting needed interventions. RTC 3 months for long COVID f/u. Also schedule with me for fatty liver (I see he was referred previously but never seen). Schedule PCP f/u.

Reviewed relative risk/benefit here for her. We decided to start with SPike Ab to at least give her some residual marker of immunity to help her decide.

Problems addressed this Visit : • Sciatica ? - 7243[I10: M54.30] . We discussed Post Covid Syndrome and how there is still so much we are learning and to be learned about this condition. It has a large spectrum of disease and there is not one medication/ intervention that can be done for all at this point. However, their concerns are not falling on deaf ears and we will work to hopefully get them feeling better. Part of the challenge with long covid is that we do not have a complete grasp on the pathophysiology of it. If we can better delineate that, our hope is that we can have a better idea on how to manage it all. At this time , a couple of the main staples in care includes symptom management and to rule out any other possible etiology contributing to the symptoms one is experiencing. I reviewed the labs that she had done in October indicating that there isn't any anemia, thyroid dysfunction, renal/hepatic issues, HIV that would cause the fatigue. She was grateful to hear about that. I discussed with her the 4 P's of energy conservation and recommended if she could enlist support from family to help her - as she works as a housekeeper and is a mother to 2 children. Recommend follow up with PT that has been consulted. Also recommend getting the pending Xrays of her back - she hasn't been able to get them done yet due to her work. Pending xray, chiro may be an option if she can adjust with her schedule. Sleep overall doesn't seem like a big issue but does note nights where it is difficult as well as occasional snoring. Could consider sleep study. will plan on f/u in a few months Addendum Addendum: Finalized: Coding Addendum : Diagnosis Coded for this visit R5383 - Other Fatigue U099 - Post Covid-19 Condition, Unspecified Procedures Coded for this visit 99212 - office sf mdm, est """

Discussed that PASC entity is still new and info being learned as we speak; suggested to check out Survivor Corps group for support. Advised I will research if any new suggestions for treatment options esp for the post covid dizziness. Discussed importance of ruling out other underlying causes. Had extensive cardiac work up. as noted I encourage he schedule the ENT consult already placed. also since having mostly vertigo type sx ongoing after covid infection and now 6 mo out, suggest Brain MRI eval. anxiety/PTSD has been described in this group as well so could have role for SSRIs. Suggest PHQ and GAD7 at next visit. He opts to await further research before deciding to start SSRI or not. • Dizziness - 7804[I10: R42] . no assoc hearing loss reported; see plan above. Addendum Addendum: Finalized: Coding Addendum : Diagnosis Coded for this visit B948 - Sequelae Of Other Specified Infectious And Parasitic Diseases R42 - Dizziness And Giddiness Procedures Coded for this visit 99214 - office mod mdm, est 2021-06-07 Subjective 47M with h/o COVID-19 infection in 2020, HLD who presents today for evaluation of dizziness. He reports that symptoms of room-spinning dizziness started shortly after he recovered from mild COVID-19- his COVID symptoms included only taste and smell loss. Initially, he had dizziness with no reliable trigger that lasted <1 minute and would resolve independently. With time, dizziness progressed and would last 3-4 days without stopping; this was accompanied by weakness, chest and abdominal pain and would require him to remain in bed. Cardiac workup for chest pain has so far been negative per the patient. He states that dizziness was occurring every few days for the last seven months. Last episode of dizziness was 3 weeks ago and he is hopeful that it has fully resolved. He was seen in vestibular PT a few months ago, but he reports that this made his symptoms worse. Denies hearing loss, otalgia, otorrhea, tinnitus, aural fullness. MRI IAC on 5/20 was negative for retrocochlear pathology. Objective General: NAD, well appearing Neuro: A&O x4, CN II-XII intact and symmetric Eyes: EOMI, PERRL Ears/Vestibular: ---AD: auricle wnl, mastoid wnl, EAC patent and clear, TM pearly and intact, ME well aerated ---AS: auricle wnl, mastoid wnl, EAC patent and clear, TM pearly and intact, ME well aerated ---Weber midline ---Rinne positive (AC > BC) bilaterally ---Negative head thrust test ---Negative Fukuda test ---Negative Dix Hallpike test ---Gait normal Nose: Dorsum midline, septum midline, no inferior turbinate hypertrophy on anterior rhinoscopy Oral cavity: Mucosa moist, dentition intact, no oral cavity masses or lesions, tongue protrudes midline Oropharynx: Mucosa moist, uvula midline, no pharyngeal erythema or cobblestoning, tonsillar fossae symmetric Neck: Soft, nontender to palpation, palpable SMGs bilaterally, no palpable LAD or thyroid nodules Assessment and Plan #Dizziness: Patient had seven months of intermittent room-spinning dizziness lasting minutes to days at a time. The differential diagnosis for dizziness remains broad. Given temporal association with COVID-19 infection, his symptoms may represent post-viral vestibular neuritis. Labyrinthis and Meniere's disease are unlikely in the absence of other otologic symptoms. I recommended referral to vestibular testing and Neurology to r/o central cause of dizziness, but patient would like to defer at this time. He will RTC for vestibular testing and Neurology referrals if dizziness returns in the future. Encouraged him to follow up with PCP to discuss ongoing chest pain and abdominal pain. All patient questions answered. The patient understands and agrees with this plan. >51% of this visit was spent on counseling.

""" 2022-03-31 Subjective Pt is a 36 year old male here as a walk in to discuss blood in his stool and abd pain. Onset: 1 day ago and blood in his stool 3-4 days ago Location: LLQ Duration: intermittent Characteristics: sharp/stabbing Aggravating/Alleviating: worse in the morning or a night before bed- worse after some meals Treatment: nothing He notes blood in his stool. He had an episode of blood in the toilet with a BM- last evening. No fevers. He also notes mentions the other vague sx's that he has been having over the last 2 months- some of his sx's include severe, intermittent headaches, feeling weak, pain in his legs and arms at times, experiencing extreme insomnia, having hot flashes, random/intermittent chest pains, feeling like he is in an mental fog and overall, he has just not been feeling well. He has been seen by the ER and other PCP's including an outside PCP for these concerns- notes all of his labs and imaging (in a recent MRI of his brain) have all been negative. He wonders if his sx's are related to a possible long haul COVID 19 diagnosis- he has been researching this on the internet and believes that his sx's match this. He read that Claritin was recommended- he took this and felt that his generalized sx's had resolved about 80%. He denies testing positive for COVID 19 but does note there's possibility that he had COVID but did not get tested. Objective Vitals and labs reviewed. General: Well nourished, well developed. Alert and in no apparent distress but he is of course, worried about his sx's. He shows a picture of a toilet bowel with blood in the water/surrounding the stool which he notes he took yesterday, 3/30/31. Assessment and Plan Blood in stool - 5781[I10: K92.1]: CBC/iron studies and stool cards ordered. STAT GI referral for EGD/colonoscopy ordered. Reviewed red flag s/s and when to be seen in the ER vs at FHCSD for follow up. Call with questions or concerns. Abdominal pain - 78900[I10: R10.9]: See above- recent labs are normal, aside from elevated bilirubin (see below). Will also order UA/culture and H Pylori testing for work up as well. Reviewed red flag s/s and when to be seen in the ER vs at FHCSD for follow up. Call with questions or concerns. Hyperbilirubinemia - 2774[I10: E80.6]: Additional labs ordered- review at follow up with his PCP as scheduled on 4/14/22. Post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC) - 1398[I10: U09.9]: Pt with several, unrelated symptoms with extensive, negative work up in the ER and with his PCPs. Will refer to PASC team- he denies knowledge of positive testing so will order antibodies as well. Will keep formal dx off his problem list and allow for the PASC team to review this with him. Encouraged him to still see psych and his PCP to rule out other causes of his various sx's.

Says she was scheduled with me because she wants a second opinion on her medical care. Specifically she is concerned about phlegm and cough for about 1.5 months now. Seen for this on 11/22 with another provider, testing for flu/strep/COVID was negative. Asking if it is related to her gastritis and if it will always be like this. Reviewing chart, I see she has seen GI for gastritis and also ENT for hoarseness. - Had EGD 10/2022 showing grade 1 EVs (non-bleeding) and mild erosive gastritis, biopsied. Next EGD due in 3 years, to f/u in office in 4-6 weeks. Pt says she has not had follow-up - was supposed to have a colonoscopy as a next step, but she is afraid because she feels she had memory issues/forgetfulness for about a month after the EGD which she attributes to the anesthesia. - Saw ENT 9/3/22, per notes she was diagnosed with left vocal cord mass c/w vocal cord cyst, plan for removal in OR; also with allergic rhinitis; advised continue reflux meds and allergy med Astelin. Pt says surgery is not scheduled because of elevated glucose - unclear to me if this was the decision of ENT or patient. - Says that ENT increased omeprazole to 40mg, taking this in the morning and famotidine at night. Continues to have sense of phlegm in throat. Asking if the liver disease is contributing to the gastritis. When I talk about her cirrhosis she initially says no end ever told her he had cirrhosis. I remind her that we have had several visits about this in the past and she then clarifies that actually she was aware that the treatment she had for hep C would take away the hep C but not the cirrhosis. Says she continues to have itching near her ankles, not improved with OTC lotions/creams.

With vocal cord lesion and known erosive gastritis, had biopsies with EGD but results unknown. Recommend f/u with GI, explain to them her reaction to the anesthesia to see if they can do something differently for colonoscopy, and needs to f/u with them regarding gastritis either way. Also recommend f/u with ENT and ask if the cough/phlegm sensation are r/t vocal cord lesion.

I agree with the referrals and treatment as recommended by PCP, encouraged her to continue with specialists but beyond that i do not have any additional recommendations at this time. • Cirrhosis of liver - 5715[I10: K74.60] .

RTC with me in 1-2 months for f/u of cirrhosis. Also will be seeing me in January for long COVID. Recommend she be followed by another provider for primary care so we can focus on specialty needs - initially my understanding was that she wanted a new PCP altogether and we were going to schedule f/u with a different provider, but pt says actually she is ok continuing care with Dr., just wanted to see me today.

Was scheduled for long COVID / FIRP initial consult but reporting sore throat to MA. In speaking with me, says she prefers to focus on long COVID today. Says she had COVID 01/2021, didn't go to hospital because whole family was home sick in bed and she needed to be there for them. Says that after illness she developed depression/anxiousness, palpitations, fatigue, hard time walking long distances and even fatigues with chewing food, muscle pains, mild headaches, dizziness, memory issues, hoarseness. Works as IHSS worker for a couple and says it's been challenging to work because of her symptoms. When asked which symptoms are the most bothersome at this time, she says the hoarseness and body pain. We will focus on these today and return to her other concerns at future visits. Hoarseness - seeing ENT, last notes on file are from 11/30/22, diagnosed with dysphonia, L vocal cord cyst, gastritis (seen on EGD), laryngeal inflammation, referred otalgia, allergic rhinitis. Offered meds for reflux and allergies and offered surgery for vocal cord cyst. Pt says she has been undecided about the surgery because it would require voice rest for a month. Says that at her most recent ENT appt they said her tongue is burned (?) and they prescribed clotrimazole 10mg pills. Says she is also taking omeprazole and famotidine as recommended. Body pains - reports pains worst in arms, legs, and back. Sometimes wakes her up at night. I see she is attending PT for dizziness and has also had PASC eval with PT, their note mentions knee pain and back pain. has f/u with them scheduled 1/24. Pt says she sometimes takes ibuprofen for the pain. Doesn't tolerate aspirin or Tylenol d/t stomach pains. I see that labs revealed low vitamin D and supplement was prescribed but pt says she is not on it. Also had anemia and was prescribed iron in the past but says she is no longer on iron either. Appears she has a pending referral to pulmonology, says she hasn't scheduled yet. Says she used to see psychiatry, can't remember why she stopped.

For hoarseness, I fear there is little I can do to assist. - Should continue meds from ENT and will consider surgery for vocal cord cyst. May benefit from speech therapy but I think she will first need to decide about surgery. For body pains, cause is not entirely clear to me. Could be an effect of long COVID (such as microclotting, neuropathy, mitochondrial issue, other) but also consider effect of low vitamin D, effect of anemia, autoimmune causes, neuropathy, and MSK causes. Will plan for in-person exam. - Check ANA, CK, RF, CRP, ESR, updated vitamin D, updated H&H, iron studies, B12, folic acid. - Start vitamin D: • Vitamin D3 : [ cholecalciferol 125 mcg (5000 intl units) oral tablet ] 01/16/2023 Qty : 30 R : 3 (Take orally 1 daily RTC 3-5 weeks in person for lab results and exam to evaluate body pains.

""" 2022-02-10 64 yo F with a history of renal carcinoma, HLD, type 2 diabetes here for thyroid enlargement. She has worsening shortness of breath that started after her covid infection in Nov 2020. She found it difficult to walk because of shortness of breath. It has been worsening over the past 4-5 months though causing her shortness of breath with minimal exertion like brushing her teeth. She had a CT scan done in Mexico and it showed a mass over her heart. The cardiologist stated her symptoms were not caused by her heart. She believes it was the thyroid over the heart.

I reviewed thyroid labs and thyroid ultrasound with the patient and her daughter today. Her thyroid is enlarged but it is not extending downward into the chest. No nodules are visualized on the thyroid ultrasound. I am curious about the mass over the heart may actually be the thymus. Unfortunately, I do not believe her symptoms of shortness of breath are related to thyroid enlargement. She had a recent CXR that showed evidence of damage from her previous covid infection.

January 16th 2021 was diagnosed, was not hospitalized , kept going to ER for same symptoms. Primary symptoms were could not breathe, most serious symptom was she had bad headaches- had never had them before in her life. She had fever, SOB could not breathe, and she was nauseated a lot, she felt like a wet noodle, she had such discomfort it was for month and months. No issues with taste and smell, had major diarrhea at that time also. Currently SOB still there: SOB now at all times, while talking to this provider she states she has to push out a breath. Was never on oxygen, got inhalers, but no real relief. She does see a pulmonologist at UCSD. She has had PFT's, CT and chest xrays. She states they found something on imaging, states they saw a thing that COVID leaves behind on lungs. This patient was a nursing assistant before, home care aid for the elderly and worked 2 different jobs always active. Since COVID has not been able to return back to her jobs. She is going out for walks and gets around the block or goes to grocery store and runs errands, is going to PT and she really likes it they doing different kinds of things that are helping her with her fatigue. SOB: Before COVID she always had asthma, but it was mild/controlled. Sometimes she feels like she is going to die bc she cant get enough air, sometimes she 'wakes up in the middle of the night'. She had a sleep study ordered by pulmonology but states a primary care provider said it wouldn't help. Told to the pulmonologist that did not want to do it. HA come and go. no hx of migraines or HA before COVID. They go across the fore head and it is 'hard to explain' per patient, they wouldn't go away. For months they would not go away, she took Tylenol and different medications but nothing for migraine HA. Eventually they dissipate but has to deal with it for a few hours. In middle of night her head feels tight and has to wake up and has to relax and relieve the tight band feeling on the back of her head. No hx of high blood pressure, actually has low blood pressure. nausea was very bad for months, now lingers. Will occasionally have nausea. noodle feeling went on for months, now it is just fatigue. Feels like she had a work out but she didn't, she is lucky if she gets one good day a week. Her fatigue has gotten better since the COVID but it is daily. She feels like she works out, she tries to ignore it but has to lay down. SHe feels pumped up when she does physical activity, she likes PT . She has hx of anxiety in the past, she did get anxiety medication when this started ( she was getting heart palpitations out of control when went to ER) She has been seen by cardiology got holter monitor, did all work up nothing wrong. Palpitations had one in the last 2-3 months. The doctor gave her Toprol. Does not want to take it as prn. palpitations were around pre COVID and are still around post COVID, body short circuited. Family hx of cardiac conditions, father ahs quadruple bypass at age 60, her brother had hear attack at age 50, grandfather had heart attack around 49. she had good heart work up before COVID, nothing out of then norm. activity of daily living- takes her a while to get up in the am, she kind of learned to take her time, if she rusehs she gets dizzy, unbalanced this has been worse with COVID. still gets SOB and nausea but ignores it, SOB of breath is always out, has to push out a sentence. She gets up every now and then , head issue or to get up is unable to get to sleep. She has tinnitus, her ears have been rinign off the chart since COVID they wont stop, she had this before COBID, but after its like volume went up, she does not have hearing loss, but sometimes she will ask what is going on. Bone spurs in her feet and she thinks it is going to the other foot too, she feels it in her other bones.

Concerns/Problems addressed during telemedicine visit with plan of action: PASC. Relatively mild. In this case it would appear that the CXR is commiserate with the symptoms. He has appropriate pulmonology f/u next week. He has PT referral for PASC which is excellent option that I""""m strongly encouraging. He does appear to be functioning well with mild sequelae. He should get a COVID booster which is ordered. I suspect that the lung function is from post-COVID - perhaps PFTs can be considered by pulmonology to assist with management but there isn't specific treatment per se for this type of fibrosis (just had this question answered yesterday by outside Pulm on other patient (credit Dr. Maley Beth Israel pulmonologist) - I was just part of a grand rounds discussion today about what to do in this scenario actually, and I think most would take a usual workup for ILD and possibly consider some of the treatments for interstitial lung disease, depending on the workup - ""usual"" ild workup could include autoimmune labs such as ANA, ANCA, CK, Aldolase, SSA/SSB, scl-70, myositis antibody panel (may need pulm at a large medical center to order that), RF, CCP, anti-smith, anti-RNP - practically, I think having a good pulmonary consult is the key next step as you mentioned. There's no textbook to tell you exactly what to do in this scenario, so ideally someone with interstitial lung disease expertise could think critically - a CT would really help understand the extent and pattern of fibrosis and if there are inflammatory findings (ground glass) that might suggest a benefit to steroids or other immune suppression. This would ideally be done with inspiratory and expiratory images too to see air trapping. - ambulatory oximetry could help just to rule out need for 02 (which is unlikely anyways if only mildly reduced dlco) - he could qualify for pulmonary rehab, or at least general physical therapy could help dyspnea. - could some other ""long covid mechanism"" play a role in the dyspnea, such as neuropathy, dysautonomia? Maybe. But I think the severe respiratory failure and objective findings on testing point us towards pursuing a full workup for the ILD first and PT approaches to improve dyspnea - I would not routinely use an anti fibrotic medication for this unless progressive because those are just meant to slow the progression of evolving fibrosis. It also wouldn't be approved by insurance for this unless it's a progressive ILD. In my experience and from data, if this is just scarring after ards it should not progress. If it's an inflammatory, autoimmune ILD then you would want to treat that early and aggressively to prevent progression. - There is no known medical treatment for post ards fibrosis if it's not determined to also be accompanied by persistent inflammation on chest CT or autoimmunity on the ILD workup. - We are seeing some persistent inflammatory ILD after COVID-19, which is why following interval PFTs 3-6 months after the first set can be helpful. A change in the DLCO would be most sensitive for progression. Then we would follow these patients intermittently (maybe every 6 months) with PFTs over a couple of years to ensure stability. Unfortunately fibrosis can't be reversed but you can improve quality of life with rehab. - I wouldn't expect an inhaler to treat this lung disease, though it's very reasonable to try. f/u PRN Addendum Addendum: Finalized: Coding Addendum : Diagnosis Coded for this visit J8410 - Pulmonary Fibrosis, Unspecified R5383 - Other Fatigue U099 - Post Covid-19 Condition, Unspecified Procedures Coded for this visit 99212 - office sf mdm, est """

The FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC are within normal limits but the mid-expiratory flow rates are disproportionately decreased and they correspond to a hyperbolic shape of the expiratory portion of the flow-volume loop. Lung volumes measured by plethysmography are within normal limits. The airways resistance, measured during quiet breathing at resting lung volume and adjusted for the lung volume, is within normal limits. DLCO is within normal limits. However, the result has not been adjusted to the patient's hemoglobin level, which could influence the measured value. The presence of reactive airway disease cannot be confirmed or refuted by today's test results. If the clinical suspicion for it is high, then a methacholine bronchoprovocation test might help disclose it.""""

New patient to me. Per medical assistant, at first it was a bit unclear what today's visit was for. Prior available medical records were partially reviewed as able. First visit with FHCSD 11/8/2018 reported chronic fatigue ongoing for two years at that time. 2/25/2019 visit documented chronic daily headaches 4/2019 worsening fatigue and receding hair line but no joint pain/muscle ache or rash She has followed with psychiatry for depression and anxiety treatment - she tried sertraline and Adderall but had side effects so stopped these medications. She had transfer of care from Dr. Erbe in 2019 to Celia Wolf in 8/2019 Documented COVID diagnosis in our records 1/12/2022; note from 2/2022 with more details. TODAY: Patient reports, """"I did get COVID a few times and symptoms got worse."""" Around the time of referral to this program, she was getting physical therapy for a broken foot and asked physical therapist about options. She states she """"kind of gave up on it all - but hasn't done anything since then, not sure what the program is."""" She reports the fatigue she experiences is """"literally debilitating."""" She adds, """"I'm supposed to be at work right now but I'm lying in bed because I can't get up."""" When asked when she was last feeling well/in good health she states it has been several years. She may not have not been well not since about 2016-2017, when she was in her early 20s. She was in school at that time when she started needing to sleep more and couldn't keep up with classes. She states she took a break from school for a year and then went back but was still tired and felt she couldn't do it still. She had only a few semesters left to graduate. But when she started to get really tired, she tried to push past it and slowly got worse and worse She is unsure if there's a clear trigger; she hadn't been seeing doctors much during that time. She reports now her symptoms are """"totally debilitating."""" She doesn't think she will get better. When discussing diagnosis of chronic fatigue - she states it seems like a lifelong thing. She has read about this and related conditions on the Internet including Reddit. She doesn't know what the cause of her symptoms was. Earlier on in her illness, she reports she was on stimulants, she states she was """"taking Adderall like crazy to give me energy."""" She was working as a CNA working at a residential care facility in 2016-2017 and reports she was able to move around and do stuff but only because of Adderall but had to stop that """"it just wasn't sustainable for me."""" She now works at a non-profit that serves the refugee and immigrant populations but she comes in late everyday She has explained to her boss about certain health issues and she reports she """"literally sometimes just can't get up."""" She shares the missed days from work """"are too many."""" She was trying to get in today but she was so tired. She feels tired every day. She reports that yesterday she """"slept 12 hours straight and still woke up exhausted."""" Experiences post-exertional malaise; anything that requires physical or mental effort -she reports afterward """"I just crash."""" She has had COVID-19 to her knowledge maybe 4 times, first time late 2020 She was hospitalized but did go to the emergency room a few times for it. She went in for extreme shortness of breath and they confirmed she had COVID-19 and sent her home without much treatment before. The most recent time this year, she got Paxlovid earlier this year When asked about prior treatments/any improvement, she reports that nothing has helped and states """"I feel that I'm rotting in bed."""" She tries sleep/rest/not moving around but doesn't feel rested At first she says she has not tried any medication specifically for fatigue, so she doesn't know but then after further discussion she has tried some medications at a time. She states the only thing she can do now is rest. Top 3 symptoms are hard to identify. When asked she describes the following: 1) fatigue/post-exertional malaise - """"inability to do anything I want to do"""" and that leads to depression, affects mental health. The fatigue causes the depression for her, not the other way around. 2) constant shortness of breath - she recently did complete pulmonary function test - was told everything looks fine, everything looks the same as two years ago She shares, """"I feel sick constantly every single day like something is wrong with my body"""" either shortness of breath or moving around, feels weak; """"I just feel like a sick person"""" 3) has had heart pain/chest pain, she reports recent echocardiogram was normal The specialist wants her to do a tilt table test because blood pressure changes She describes """"weird numbness and tingling"""" - limbs go numb and feels pins and needle She doesn't know why - thinks could be lack of movement Prior medications also reviewed. With duloxetine/Cymbalta - she thought it was for mental health issues only - she got nausea/vomiting, felt ill/did not tolerate. Rx was from 2/25/2020 to 3/5/2020 for duloxetine 30 mg. She states she has struggled with chronic nausea in the past anyway and would get frequent headaches as well. For prior H. pylori, she reports she never did treatment course for this. She has chronic gastrointestinal issues with nausea and in the past vomiting. She saw gastroenterology specialist who did an endoscopy and she was told she didn't have H. pylori infection on those biopsies. She would prefer to do repeat testing prior to treatment. She share when she had a work event; while getting ready for it, she had to rest every 10 mins, just to get ready; has to conserve energy. She reports issues as well with brain fog- that she """"can't think straight."""" She feels she constantly experiences this and it affects her work performance. She deals with chronic pain every day She shares somebody said something about fibromyalgia to her. When asked about medications tried, she is not sure if anything was specifically for fatigue. She mentions modafinil - has heard about as well. At first doesn't report she is currently taking it but she has prescriptions on file for this in CURES in January, February, April, May, June She shares she is not opposed to medication; she understands can't guarantee will feel better on it. She has no known medication/drug allergies. She reports multiple environmental allergies, randomly breaks out in hives, one time head to toe She reports she was told they never seen anything like this/didn't know what it could be. On Ambien for sleep from psychiatry/mental health. She reports prior she tried hydroxyzine - was given for anxiety but didn't notice any relief, before Ambien. She is now seeing Dr. , outside of FHCSD since beginning of the year. Her sister sees him as well. She shares she tried modafinil but didn't help much so far. She shares symptoms did get worse with COVID-19 infection. ROS completed with pertinent findings noted above, otherwise negative. Patient history reviewed and updated.

She is asking if there are any experts in the area for chronic fatigue like illnesses. I explained I am part of this program (LC&FIRP) and she shares some ideas that could be of help. Today, she feels """"pretty much the same"""" since our first telemedicine visit in July. She wanted to come in person today but she was too tired so switched the visit to telehealth. For prior history of H. pylori, she picked up the stool sample supplies for testing but timing/logistics have been difficult. She deals with intermittent constipation as well. When having a bowel movement, sometimes forgets about the testing. Doesn't go every day. Had prior Rx for Colace and it did work for her in the past. Hospitalized in July and this was prescribed. Sometimes caused a little bit of diarrhea. She is getting ongoing care at UPAC. She states she had a sleep study in 2020 - therapist had told her if the study was looking for sleep apnea, it may not have evaluated other sleep disorders. The patient has concerns she may not be getting enough deep/restorative sleep or REM sleep. She will often sleep 12-16 hours and still wakes up fatigued. She describes it as upon awakening """"it feels like I just closed my eyes."""" Symptom burden and extreme fatigue are very debilitating. She found a digital community on Reddit online, connects with other people dealing with this. She has been reading some about thyroid and endocrinology- she had a workup in 2019 and per endocrinologist her symptoms were not likely due to any hormonal cause. She shares she attended attended a hyper- and hypo-thyroid seminar in the past She had a psychiatrist at UPAC who was going to try some kind of thyroid medication, (?Dr. but she states she's not seeing him anymore, he recently left the clinic. She states he called himself an advanced psychiatrist. She has an appointment with the new psychiatrist in a few weeks. She is clear that her mood symptoms are from her physical symptoms (extreme fatigue) rather than mood symptoms causing fatigue. Body pain """"comes and goes"""" and she is not interested in seeing a pain medicine specialist right now. She does want to see a neurologist for what she describes as """"nerve issues."""" She feels burning pain in both feet frequently. She gets tingling and numbness sometimes every hour. She states her extremities (arms and hands and legs and feet) """"get numb for no reason."""" She might be interested in low-dose naltrexone. She had some workup with Cardiovascular Institute of San Diego (CVISD) and was referred for a tilt test, to eval for POTS. She is not sure what happened with that referral and will call the referring office to ask. She has not seen Dr for primary care recently and would like to see her again.

First in-person visit together today. She shares she has ongoing fatigue. She reports she is now on two different antidepressants now: Lexapro 20 mg and Auvelity (bupropion/dextramethorphan) recommended by psychiatrist Dr. She shares the medication is not really helping at all, but she is still giving it time. She defers seeing primary care resident physician for now the reason given being she thinks the only recommendation will be to talk with a therapist. She takes Pepcid as needed; not daily. She reports it is rarely needed actually. She shares she has a history GERD as well. She is also reporting dysphagia, estimated onset for 3 to 4 years. For example, when she would eat a cookie, after 5 hours it still feels like it is stuck in her throat. Dysphagia to solids explained first, when asked also states it happens with liquids. She reports a globus sensation/food gets stuck in the mid throat.She previously saw an ENT specialist who did some kind of swallow study, perhaps modified barium swallow vs. esophagram. She states she was told her swallow/""""everything was fine"""" and they said she may not have GERD but she's not sure how they could conclusively rule that out. She also previously had an endoscopy. She describes fatigue as """"battling for energy."""" She has tried drinking energy drinks but then that has led to increased anxiety. So then she would take propranolol to decrease the anxiety symptoms. Patient is also requesting refills of hydroxyzine - she has taken up to 100 mg capsules three times a day in the past. Has ongoing issues unrefreshed by sleep. Sleep study not scheduled for several months. She is on the wait list. Can help with allergy symptoms and insomnia for her. She has ongoing body pain issues as well, that compared to the fatigue is more manageable. She asks about whether to see a rheumatologist. She has been reading about chronic fatiguing illnesses online. She has no swollen/inflamed joints per se. She saw a neurologist for evaluation of lower back pain with paresthesia and pain in the lower extremities for around five or more years. She shares he told her that if she got married and had kids then her problems not be so bothersome because she would be so busy with raising kids. This was an upsetting comment to her as she perceived it was a sexist remark and that the doctor was more casual with her because of shared faith backgrounds. She reports the fatigue """"outweighs everything"""" and she feels """"sedated constantly"""" to the point she could sleeps 12 hours and then feel that she needs to nap an hour after waking up. She describes her fatigue as extreme. She had an acupuncture session yesterday. She is not sure it is going to help but she was told to give it time and she is willing to give it a try. She has ongoing concern for POTS and her prior referral expired. She would like to follow up for recommended tilt table testing. She has questions about prior CBC results, with regard to white blood cells and red blood cells. She states she was in the ER this past summer and noticed some abnormalities. She previously saw hematology in the past. She politely defers updating blood tests today. Toward the end of the visit she notes she has had weight gain this year.

""" 2022-04-25 Subjective New pt to me. 53 yr female. Pt c/o vertigo since 2/2021. Pt c/o recurrent dizziness and nausea. Also endorses chronic paresthesia of the bilateral LE's. She has previously been treated with steroids and meclizine which were ineffective. There is constant ringing in the ears with varying pitches, there is frequent electric shock sensation flowing through the body. The room is moving. No recent falls or injury. She had a Covid exposure in December 2020. Both of her partners parents had Covid and were in close proximity to her. She did not develop any symptoms and therefore, did not get tested. She developed the vertigo after the Covid exposure. She was seen by the Neurology Center , and completed a normal ECHO in 7/2021, and an EMG which was normal in 11/2021. Pt also reports completing an EEG which was normal, but we don't have that report. She stated that she has had multiple MRI's of the brain and spine that have been unrevealing. She trialed gabapentin. Pt says gabapentin was ineffective and she """"felt off"""". Patient reports improvement with chiropractic treatment overall. Decreased pain level and improved tolerance for functional ADL activities. Also Acupuncture helps. She was seen by a Neurologist, who diagnosed a Tic Disorder. Dr., neuro-otologist, thought it was labyrinthitis, post-viral. She also saw Dr. 9/2021, 10/2021, 12/2021 who has stated that there is no signs of central vertigo, and that it is peripheral in origin, with associated adjustment disorder and a mild sensory neuropathy. The etiology is likely a post-viral labyrinthitis. She has had multiple spinal MRI's and brain MRI's with and without contrast. All of these studies were normal. Due to her family history of early breast Cancer in her sister and endometrial Cancer in her mother, she completed anti-hu antibodies as well as other paraneoplastic antibodies. Had mammo done, and was BiRADS 2, benign. Paraneoplastic panel came back normal. Her serum lead was normal and all other blood work-up for neuropathy has been normal. Has another Brain MRI scheduled 5/11/22. Was referred to psychiatry but has not followed through. Pt was seeing PCP Dr. , but they have left the practice. Pt takes Klonopin prn for symptom relief (Dr. prescribing). Objective Vitals Reviewed.

She reports she believes she had Covid late December 2020/ early January 2021. Said at that time, her partner's parents came over and they had a nice visit, face to face without masks. The following day the parents tested positive. She felt off, but never acutely ill. Never got tested. However, about a month after she started to have vertigo. She would have hard spins and feel like everything was moving around 360 degrees. She reports she was a healthy person prior without every going to the ED, and then suddenly she had multiple ED visits due to the vertigo. She reports the symptoms include the vertigo where she is able to stand but feels the world spinning. Also has tinnitus bilaterally and is constant but the intensity varies. She also notes tingling of her extremities, and feeling of electrical pulses. A new symptom she started having for the past month was with headaches that she feels are migraines and says feels like pressure. She takes ibuprofen 800 as needed which helps. Also has disrupted sleep - says can wake up to 30 times a night. Thinks part of it is from the vertigo. Over the past year and a half she has seen multiple specialists and had many images. She said she went throught he process of BPPV and had some vestibular rehab, but ended up taking up pickle ball which she finds similar as she follows the ball with her eyes. Also trial of meclizine which was not helpful. She also has tried low dose clonazepam which she takes as needed -said this helps as it just pretty much zones her out so she doesn't notice all the other symptoms. She also reports many MRIs with neurology and MS was ruled out. She has also seen ENT and an Otoneurologist . Had imaging there as well. Said the one other thing Dr. recommended was a CT of temporal bone (?) She has also had acupuncture and was prescribed some 'heavy steroids' previously. Said she felt pretty good on the steroids, but wasn't a long term solution. With her vertigo she has had some falls, but is getting somewhat more accustomed to her limitations now.

Today she has a TH visit with me for initial Long Covid. She shares she has had a couple of covid illnesses. Says the first was early 2021 and then got sick again in January 2022. She thinks she may have gotten sick as she worked as a caregiver. Overall seems she had recovered after initial 2021 and 2022 illness, but then in June 2022 is when she said she started with symptoms. Said she had a lot of chest discomfort initially. Currently, main symptom is right sided body pain. Says her ear, neck, shoulder, and leg all on the right side hurt. She reports decreased strength and had issues completing her iADLs and her fmaily has been helping out. She can't drive any more due to the right sided pain. Has gone to urgent care before due to the pain and has been following with her PcP. She was recently prescribed nortriptyline and has noted some improvement with that medication - feels she is able to do more around the house to help her family. She also feels she is sleeping better with this medication. Had MRI scans done before and was referred to orthopedics, but has not yet seen them. Has not seen neurology.

It has a large spectrum of disease and there is not one medication/ intervention that can be done for all at this point. Part of the challenge with long covid is that we do not have a complete grasp on the pathophysiology of it. If we can better delineate that, our hope is that we can have a better idea on how to manage it all. At this time , a couple of the main staples in care includes symptom management and to rule out any other possible etiology contributing to the symptoms one is experiencing. • Follow Up : Keep Currently Scheduled Appointment(s) PRN sooner as needed - has f/u with me next month.

Exam and vitals unremarkable today, normal nonfocal neurologic exam. Best course of action is for her to follow up with specialists she is already seeing and for us to f/u on her ER workup. I am concerned about splitting behavior she is exhibiting - may have component of borderline pd. I am also concerned with her reports that she may lose her job, reaffirmed to her that we are happy to help her with disability paperwork but again she needs to bring the paperwork to clinic or submit it online and we will do our part after, will refer to case manager to try and provide some guidance and assistance with this as patient seems to have had a difficult time navigating this process. - Case Management Referral - request records from ER, UCSD gyn, UCSD ID Assessment and Plan Problems addressed this Visit : • Post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC) - 1398[I10: G93.39] .

M with pmh significant for anal fistula, chronic low back pain, HTN, history of COVID, here for f/u leg pain, thrombocytopenia. Patient has prior history of COVID May 2021. Patient also used to work as a Plumber and was exposed to different chemical. Patient states has had chronic cough, fatigue, wheezing since about 1-2 months ago. Reviewed recent CXR results. Evidence of low lung volumes with bilateral patchy airspace infiltrate. Nonspecific finding, but may be COVID pneumonitis. Patient also endorsing left shoulder pain and left arm weakness. MRI shoulder ordered that was normal, but unable to see distal biceps tendon. Patient also endorsing numbness/tingling of the left arm radiating down to wrist. Already has referral to Sports Medicine Objective Physical exam deferred Labs reviewed: CONCLUSION: 1. Low lung volumes with patchy bilateral airspace infiltrates. This is a nonspecific finding but can be seen with COVID pneumonitis. Correlate clinically. 2. The IHS convey results process was initiated to ensure communication of this report to the referring clinician. 7/26/21: MRI humerus left w/o contrast: CONCLUSION: No visible abnormality. The distal biceps tendon lies beyond the inferior margin of this examination and would be best evaluated with a dedicated MRI examination of the left elbow if clinically indicated.

"2022-04-01 Subjective 41 yr old woman with h/o 'chronic lyme', EBV, SLE, and potentially long COVID, referred for initial ID consult. PCP North Park, now to El Cajon, but hasn't seen the same primary care provider more than once. H/o Thyroid Cancer s/p thyroidectomy, lymph nodes and 2 parathyroids taken out. Usual health until around 2017, was going in for tubal ligation. Was working out, working. After BTL, vision changed x 6 months. (20:20 --> now 2.5 readers). Since then, energy and libido took a hit. 'Something's Wrong'. A lot of blood panels sent, no answer. Having chronic fatigue, falling asleep reading to kids. About 1 year after, still looking for answers, EBV panel 'persistently positive' Lyme titers equivocal. In process of workup, found positive ANA but 'low level', so never on medication. Stable low-level joint pains. Hasn't been on any therapy ever. Long history of tick-bites in childhood, has had many taken off. Pfizer #1 3/25/21 #2 4/15/21 - COVID rapid test positive 8/2022. mild-moderate, never hospitalized. No Pulse-Ox COVID symptoms: - sinus congestion - cough x 1 month - pressure on chest Since COVID, more long term symptoms: ongoing joint pain, hips locked up, knees locked up, 'couldn't move'. Ongoing irritation in a few joints. Booster (dose #3) had flare in joint pains. Has had in last few months rashes in armpits (getting botox to decrease sweat). Was given some topical steroids. Anti-fungals made no difference. Dermatologist has called 'hyperhidrosis'. Also some Raynaud's syndrome. Sweats more when cold than hot. Recently has urethral sling 3/22/22 for long standing prolapse and incontinence. With activity does have post-Exertional malaise. Does have ongoing joint pains, headaches. Does have ongoing brain fog, word-finding difficulty. Gets winded more easily. Feeling that she can't catch her breath. Improved from August but not back to normal. Thinks it might be deconditioning. ROS: significant weight gain Heavier than she's ever been in last 3 yrs. Walking is normal, but if hiking. Walks 30-90 minutes per day (just has surgery). Dog (120 lbs) walking daily. Has been in therapy in the past. Not recently. Masking is hard for breathing. Possibly some Tachycardia/palpitations. When stood up from getting off the plane whouldn't move . PMedHx: Migraines since childhood Congenital spinal abnormalities (C1-C2 growth) Urge urinary incontinence - two vaginal home births, gradual worsening Hypothyroidism - 125 QD + extra 75 mcg on Sundays SocHx: EtOH starting in last 2 yrs - 1-2 seltzers with vodka daily tried THC but doesn't like Tobacco: denies lives with two kids and housemate. massage therapist - working 12-20 hours/week.

Concerns/Problems addressed during telemedicine visit with plan of action: Problems addressed this Visit : • History of COVID-19 Infection - V0182[I10: z86.16] . • Lyme disease - 08881[I10: A69.20] . • Epstein-Barr virus antibody in serum positive - 7964[I10: D82.3] . • Fatigue - 78079[I10: R53.83] . • Chronic fatigue syndrome - 78071[I10: R53.82]. • Post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC) - 1398[I10: U09.9]. - Overall picture is of significant disability, definite criteria of ME/CFS which is interfering with her ADLs and iADLs. She has already been contacted by disability office. Will also connect her with local Center for Independent Living, a great resource to connect with disability application and other work accomodations. https://acl.gov/programs/centers-independent-living/list-cils-and-spils - Discussed limited therapeutic options at this point, but possibility to work through her symptoms together and partner with goal to improve quality of life. - She seems to meet official criteria for ME/CFS at this point due to unrefreshed sleep, significant post-exertional malaise, and >6 months of functional impairment. - May be some additional long-COVID related pathology at play as evidenced by rashes (? MAST Cell Activation), tachycardia (particularly when getting up from seated position), brain fog/cognitive dysfunction, perhaps PoTS or autonomic instability. - She seems to have disrupted sleep- I've begun with education regarding the diagnosis, pacing, self-monitoring using wearable device, etc. - Shared resources for patient groups such as Body Politic, ME Action, and Long COVID Alliance. - Need to assess autonomic testing at next visit with NASA lean test, perhaps review her fitbit/Garmin data • Pruritic disorders - 6989[I10: L29.9]. - Could potentially be related to MCAS as a post-COVID condition as this has been seen in PASC patients. Hydroxyzine should help and we are also exploring higher dose anti-histamines. She will uptitrate doses of OTC anti-histamine. • Minimal cognitive impairment - 33183[I10: G31.84]. - MRI done for this purpose and as standard 'brain fog' workup. Would benefit from cognitive testing, but not sure of availability of this. Incidental finding of 1 x 2 cm Arteriovenous malformation in R frontal lobe. I don't think this is cause or even related to cognitive symptoms, but may be nidus of headache stimulation and deserves neurosurgical evaluation. Consultation sent. • Unspecified Depression - 311[I10: F32.A]. • Anxiety - 30000[I10: F41.9]. - mental health for therapy is scheduled for July. She wants something now for anxiety which is biggest and most concerning symptoms. Will send in hydroxyzine for immediate use. - She is already plugged into mental health, but would consider activating antidepressant such as Wellbutrin. f/u 2 months to regroup on all referrals and workup thus far.

She is trying to keep a better record of what can do. She is now more aware of it and will limit the amount of clints she has and will not put clients back to back. She does have a couple of main issues that she would like addressed: 1. PFT results . Had PFTs last month but did not hear about the results. Has appt with pulmonology but is a couple months out. 2. would like neurosurgery referral redirected because where she was sent there is not availabiltiy for a couple months as well. She did some research and came across: C&E Neurosurgery San Diego she was told they will need: referral from provider, authorization, CPT code , and MRI 3. she has been having intermittent numbness/tinging of certain areas of the face and body. is interested in further work up for this Objective Physical exam deferred Labs reviewed: Assessment and Plan Follow-up: 1 Select as a Telemedicine call Clinic/office appointment or As needed/PRN Informed patient that a follow-up call from the nursing staff will be coming shortly to review the visit.

I agree with Dr. and what he previously documented. In the time I spoke with her, I was able to appreciate how her symptoms are quite disabling. She has been learning ways to cope and has been monitoring her symptoms which can be helpful for pacing and prioritizing. Problems addressed this Visit : • Numbness - 7820[I10: R20.0] . • Tingling of skin - 7820[I10: R20.2] . due to varying areas that can be affected, will place neuro referral for full evaluation (rather than EMG that would be part specific) • Consult: NEUROLOGY (VERIFY AUTH REQUIREMENT ) [Referral Valid until 01/01/2023] Consult, Problems addressed this Visit : • Short of breath - 78605[I10: R06.02] . we reviewed PFT results. from my understanding and reference range of 'normal' or expected results, she falls into those categories for FVC, FEV1, TLC, DLCO. also did not seem there was a profound difference before bronchodilators and after. i encourage her to follow up with pulmonology for a more detailed assessment of the testing and further recommendations # AVM in right frontal lobe. I placed a new referral for the neurosurgeon that the patient found that has availability and takes her insurance. Later I was able to speak to the referrals department as well who were able to redirect the original referral to dr. • Follow Up : Keep Currently Scheduled Appointment(s), routine f/u with Dr. Ramers Coding Addendum : Diagnosis Coded for this visit Q048 - Other Specified Congenital Malformations Of Brain R0602 - Shortness Of Breath R200 - Anesthesia Of Skin R202 - Paresthesia Of Skin Procedures Coded for this visit 99214 - office mod mdm, est 2022-08-18 Subjective 42 yo presents for PASC/ ME follow up. Typically follows with Dr., however, I spoke with her about 6 weeks ago. Since I saw her, she was able to see the neurosurgeon. The surgeon said that he does not see immediate indication for treatment with surgery or radiation; however, those are both options. She said the spot radiation could take 2-5 years. She conveyed to me that the doctor said that d/t where the aneurysm is located, even if she were to have a CVA she would likely still be quite functional. He does want her to get CTA to make sure no other AVM. She has the CT scan scheduled for right after this appt. He also said if any change in regular headaches/ migraines , or if memory/speech get worse, then to get assessed sooner for possible intervention. Last time I spoke with her, there was also thought that she was going to have pulm follow up - but turns out that is not the case. She said that it was f/u with Dr. She continues to have migrating 'traveling ant sensation' along her body. Will also get twinges/ frozen/ locked muscles. Said when this happens most don't last for more than 30 minutes. Did see neurology who rx a topical agent. She is also scheduled to come in for EMG of all extremities. She also tried for disability but said she makes too much to qualify - however, she is making less than her cost of living. She works in massage therapy. Has been doing less intense treatments like for lymphatic drainage. Also is seeing dermatology, saw yesterday. Was given a steroid shot (Kenalog) for eczema/psoriasis but said may help with joints ; prior to that had tried topical steroid creams which wasn't helping. She is also getting botox in armpits now for hyperhidrosis Had received hydroxyzine but said she did not tolerate it. Made her very sleepy. She has a few questions for me: - heard about new lyme tx/ vaccine and is interested in could partake in any trials or maybe her children? - interested in mental health (was previously referred) - feels narcolepsy is coming back (wondering about treatment) Objective Vitals Reviewed.

Headaches worse when standing. Frequency of headaches is increased to 3-4 per week. Previously 1-2/month. More nausea occurring, vision change still a problem. Exacerbating factors: standing can provoke headaches, but it seems that bending over Since last visit had additional workups: - Neurosurgery saw him: no immediate surgery recommended after initial MRI's; but recommended Radiation ONcology. - Rad Onc recommended 'spot radiation'; but could exacerbate SLE. - CT angio was done and 4 additional AVM's were found - She was told to contact office if she has more headaches, which she's now having. - Rheumatology visit pending Breathing has been improving. PFTs reviewed and normal. Has had more knee and hip pain. Sports Medicine visits with injections in each knee and she is now having more function in each knee. Told she has 'low cartilage'.

Had Integrative medicine consult 9/19/22 and was referred to see me for ongoing primary care needs after Dr. stopped working here at CHFHC. Dr. had some recommendations including to restart yoga. Prior saw FNP starting 10/2019. Today she has questions about COVID-19 booster. She is thinking about getting a booster but shares she had a rather bad reaction last time; feels cause pain """"straight to the knees for two months."""" For migraines, less than 2-3 times would need to use sumatriptan. Requesting refill as this has had good effect in the past without adverse effects. For prior positive ANA 1:80, had one consult with rheumatologist in La Mesa from 11/2019 - and will see within the next month for further consultation. Per that note, had insidious onset of severe fatigue for six months, and at the time the patient was concerned about positive antibody test for Epstein Barr Virus. Per assessment """"no evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus/connective tissue disorder"""" but symptoms thought to be multifactorial in nature. She states she was referred back due to rheumatology after findings of """"at least 4 supratentorial AVMs, the largest measuring 1.9 cm of the right frontal lobe"""" which were incidental findings per note from Dr. Siavash Jabbari of Radiation Oncology (Sharp Memorial). Basically, the specialist was hoping to have repeat ANA titers and a call regarding her reported lupus. For PASC/ME/CFS, had eval in April 2022 with Dr. Ramers. Had COVID in early August 2021. Today, patient reports that infection """"triggered my Lyme again."""" Has not felt in usual state of health until around 2017 prior to tubal ligation. Due to all the health problems, have made everyday functioning and work challenging at times. This loss has contributed to feelings of depression.

""" 2021-03-23 Concerns/health issues discussed: Post-COVID symptoms. Now at history of COVID stage but having relapses. Work note for 2 weeks given HM: Schedule WWE Depression/anxiety. Tearful when discussing death of mom approx. 1 year ago. Needs tie in to mental health. Ordered Lack of insurance but insurable: refer to insurance assistance This is mostly f/u for ear pain, headaches from that. I had a telehealth last week. Depression: saw Mental Health Telehealth on the 3rd She had COVID and had f/u symptoms - particularly her sense of smell Distant hx of ocular fracture/complex or at least that resulted in an orbital fracture requred surgery and then had a cyst required drainage. She has pressure in that same area that concerns her. That same side causes some pain at her ear at times that can be quite severe. But no tinnitis. She's taking naproxen. The headaches are more that side too. Two things needed today 1. The CT orbit was declined by insurance. We should appeal that since they're suggesting MRI but I disagree since much here related to prior ORIF 2. Needs new note for work The CT apparently she was told by IHS to order 70480. That's exactly what I ordered in Feb, and they then told me to order 70486. So today I""""ll leave both orders available for their best judgement to choose. Goal is to get brain CT and focus on (R) orbital due to her HA's. 3. She had a fall and hit to back of head no LOC, has felt balance isn't great. Overall anxiety is high. She is starting CBD to try to help Patient Presents with : • Depression - 311[I10: F32.9] . • Chronic alcoholism in remission - 30393[I10: F10.21] . • History of COVID-19 Infection - V0182[I10: z86.16] . • Amphetamine or psychostimulant use disorder in remission - 30443[I10: F15.11] .

Other meds were tried: Elavil worsened fatigue (was attempt at migraine prophylaxis), mexlizine did help but so did gabapentin that she tried so we continued that. Zoloft tried and failed to help She got covid which had pretty bad s/e's so reluctant to do booster She had loss of smell and smell of gasoline for months afterwards Updates: November started to smell again, and coincidentally knees stopped hurting She's reluctant to do booster but is going to get it Stabbing headaches also gone Three years clean and sober PT ongoing has improved a lot Objective • 09/08/2021 5:33:00 PM - OccultBld Immuno QL (Polymedco)[Portal] : Negative - [Negative ] Very pleasant Still taking gabapentin Heart RRR Lungs CTAB no c/c/e No remarkable neuro findings today Assessment and Plan PASC most symptoms seem resolved There's nothing in terms of interevention other then passage of time in this case The question is whether she should get a boostser.

She's had bereavement from loss of her father. She missed some of her physical therapy. She feels 'off her track'. She did get new teeth. Staying clean. She's had though low energy, wonders if the PASC returned. But in fact she's also had a lot of stress - loss of father, some underlying depression bubbling up. Poor relationship with father's wife. She never did go back to work though felt she was ready in December. Denies loss of taste or smell or the odd smells from prior but wonders if it was returning. Denies the tachycardia or ice pick headaches like prior. Objective General. NAD. BP noted. A/O x 4 Nice lady but tearful at times.

My sense is that her current complaints are other things - like depression, bereavement and so there's stress from that. Regarding disability she can still apply for that for time she had COVID last year and long COVID. But we had cleared her for work in December. In terms of disability I am happy to fill out if she applies. Explained it's not unemployment. However, if she is feeling she can't work now I would state it would be for a different reason (e.g. suspecting more adjustment d/o vs depression) Bereavement, depression. Refer to Mental health. She agrees that she needs mental health therapy. Father's new wife has been issue. HM: will check cholesterol and CMP.

First visit for him in a year. He is 56 yo high functioning individual who had COVID in Feb 2021. He has been experieincing Long COVID symptoms since. He used to work as a programmer and now cannot on many occasions even understand programs when he looks at them. He get random bouts of fatigue that will cause him to sleep for 18 hours or more. There is no precipitating factors for this. He has not sought out help and in fact had hoped in seeing me today that there would be some breakthroughs since last seen in 2021. His DM is well controlled and he has already reviewed his labs online, googled meaning and has realized (correctly) pretty much how to interpret them. Yet he is functioning at a point of being unable to work as he can forget even sometimes how to spell simple words. Still struggling with PASC fatigue. Sometimes will sleep from 2 pm to noon following day! Unclear what the triggers are for him. Sometimes will trigger COVID like sx's again - diarrhea, etc. He will feel fine for a while then out of the blue it comes back again.

Assessment and Plan Problems addressed this Visit : • HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis - V0179[I10: Z20.6] . PrEP Follow-up Assessment/Counseling and Plan: High risk evaluation completed: The patient remains at risk of acquiring HIV Laboratory testing reveals no contraindication for initiation/continuation of Truvada (negative HIV testing, absence of a significant ALT/AST elevation and Cr Cl equal to or > 60 mL/min) The patient wishes to start/continue the use of Truvada for a PrEP indication. The patient received the following counseling: - PrEP therapy should be used in conjunction with safer sex practices including the consistent use of condoms to decrease the risk of HIV infection, knowing one's HIV status and that of their partner(s) and being tested regularly for other STIs that potentially increase HIV transmission risk when they are present. Although the use of PrEP therapy can significantly reduce the risk of acquiring HIV, it is not 100% effective in eliminating that risk. - The importance of medication adherence - If blood testing reveals HIV infection, use of Truvada for a PrEP indication should be discontinued.

She started lexapro about a month ago as concern anxiety was component of SOB. Anxiety is better now and SOB is better. But feels cough/SOB is worsening on misty/ damp days. Also has poor sleep - uses an aura ring which helps her track her sleep. And her 'rest sleep is very chronically low'. REM is less than 30 minutes. Has to be in bed for 8 hours, even though doesn't get 8 hours of sleep. If is in bed for less than 8 hours, just can't function the next day. Wakes up frequently during the night. Also hard to fall asleep - 'has to work to get to sleep' like taking melatonin, chamomile tea. Additionally, reports brain fog and trouble with word finding. but feels long term memory is intact. Continues to have PEM. Will work about 3-4 days a week. Has some flexibility to pace herself/ schedule clients. works about 3-4 days a week She has seen pulmonology - had PFTs - was given inhaler, but as mentioned, felt the albuterol didn't help and combo inhaler helped with SOB symptoms, but felt jittery, so hasn't been taking it. No PMHx prior to covid with exception to gestational DM. no tobacco, etoh, drug use If she could have one symptom rectified it would be the fatigue.

We discussed long covid/ PASC and how we are still learning more about the pathophysiology and how best to manage patients. One main factor of which is to r/o other etiologies of her ongoing symptoms as well so we can best dictate management. In her case, I think it is good to f/u with cardiology for which she has an appt next week to verify her dyspnea and palpitations are not coming from a cardiac origin. As she had previously seen pulm / had PFTs and an inhaler was prescribed and she did not improvement with it, I suggested that maybe she can try a different inhaler to see if she will still get the respiratory benefits but without the adverse reaction that she couldn't tolerate. An additional step I would consider for her is a sleep study as she is having insomnia, to r/o any sleep disorder that could be contributing. From what she described, it does seem like she fits criteria for ME/CFS diagnosis as well d/t the fatigue, post exertional malaise, the nonrestorative sleep and the brain fog. we discussed management can be difficult at times, because some medications that may improve one aspect may have SE that exacerbate another. will continue to follow with patient and f/u cardiology recs and sleep study results.

Her history of choking sensation especially at night making it difficult for her to sleep as she imagines somebody is choking her points towards this. She has had an ultrasound of her carotids which was normal. Due to her dysphagia, it is making it difficult for her to eat and as a result is losing weight. She has no family history of cancer and no fevers. Although she admits to night sweats I believe which is related to her panic attacks. Although, I cannot rule out the possibility of head and neck cancers despite the fact that she does not smoke or drink or do any drugs. I will obtain a CT of her neck soft tissue and a 2 view chest x-ray. I will consult gastroenterology for a screening colonoscopy although she had a negative FIT in April of this year.

""" 2023-01-24 Subjective 54 yo presents for routine evaluation, H pylori f/u. She has been feeling ok overall since I last saw her. Said she did have cold like symptoms over new years, covid negative, no need to go to ED or hospital. Now feeling better. Her stomach symptoms had improved after stopping H pylori treatment. She does also mention how she had prior diagnosis of lupus which seemed to improve after menopause. But one thing she has noted is her memory isn't as good. She noted that since her covid illness in 2020. She tells me that she 'tenia verguenza' - that she is embarassed to mention it, but has noted it in her life. Feels she is having memory lapses both for short term and longer term. A couple examples she gives me is she will forget where she puts things, or why she entered a particular room. Also helps care for her 7 month grandchild and will have to write down when she fed him because she will forget. Additionally, she is separated from her husband and she said for good reasons, but sometimes will miss him and forget why they are no longer together. Again she feels this all started after covid. Does feel fortunate to be alive as she was sick but the memory issues really concern her as she is only 54 yo. One last concern is that she feels her eyesight isn't as good and she needs a new eye doctor appt. Unfortunately had missed a prior appt d/t not having transportation to get there.

Advised pt at start of visit that I will no longer be providing PASC consult care starting this Fall, so will complete appt today and arrange for f/u with a different provider in the future. PCP/referred by: No PCP listed, no referral found on file. Initial COVID infection was near beginning of pandemic. Had been incarcerated, developed a massive headache and was found to have a brain hemorrhage. Very son after discharge from that he got COVID and was again hospitalized. Says they considered an experimental infusion but before getting it he developed a-fib and cardiology ultimately recommended against it. Has had several long term symptoms since then, largely neurocognitive issues, and says thus it has been hard to tease out what comes from PASC and what is 2/2 brain bleed. Has not noticed improvement over time with most symptoms, and in fact some are worsening. Main issues have been as follows: - Trouble with thinking of spelling simple words early on. Better now but not resolved. Has learned to adapt and cover up his mistakes. Has to plan his sentences in his head before speaking. - Trouble focusing. Often starts something then gets sidetracked and moves on to something else, often has 10 different tasks going at once and hard time finishing. - Difficulty retaining information. Keeps a planner, but when he reads his schedule for the day he can't hold the information in his head. - Trouble finding things. - Headaches (sees neurology, says nothing has worked, currently on gabapentin). - Toes burning (sees neurology, on gabapentin). When I ask about sleep, he endorses often getting no more than 2-3 hours of sleep per night. Has anxiety/depression/PTSD, also is disturbed by chronic pain and toes burning. Has a psychiatrist through FHCSD and through the VA, says FHCSD mostly addresses depression and VA mostly addresses PTSD/TBI. Reports having tried a few meds for sleep (in med hx here I see melatonin in the past, mirtazapine currently). Says he was previously an ER trauma RN. Continues to be very active, walks about 5 miles most day, no significant fatigue issues. Eats healthy. Limits alcohol to about 1 drink per week.

PASC after COVID illness early in pandemic, shortly following a hospitalization for a brain hemorrhage which clouds the clinical picture since many of his ongoing symptoms could be from brain injury, PAS, post-ICU syndrome, or all of the above. Symptoms primarily consist of neurological and cognitive issues, including chronic headaches, burning sensation in toes, issues with focusing/distractibility, challenges with working memory, some speech challenges. Experiencing severe insomnia which I suspect is exacerbating these symptoms. Will touch base with psychiatry about insomnia. Will look into whether there are local occupational therapists that have experience treating long COVID patients, to help with organization/daily functioning. Continue follow up with neurology. Discussed strategies to improve focus. Encouraged to limit multitasking whenever possible, try instead to complete one task from start to finish before moving on to the next, even if the task is simple. Discussed reducing external distractions such as having TV or radio on in the background. Advised that PASC team will contact him to schedule with a new provider shortly, and he should contact us if he does not receive a call by the end of the month.

Prior covid history previously outlined, but as he recounts he had a spontaneous brain hemorrhage that was quite bad and he is 'lucky to be alive'. He required ICU level of care and then was discharge to a nursing facility. Said about a week after discharge he was diagnosed with covid. Difficult to ascertain how severe his symptoms were as he was pretty ill from prior brain bleed. But that there was discussion of giving an infusion treatment, but ultimately cardiologist did not agree with it as it was something new and there was concern it would have deliterious effects on his heart/ A fib. Unable to say what month this was, but just earlier on in the pandemic. Symtpoms he has had, and he says can be difficult to differentite if due to covid vs sequelea of brain bleed: - headache - """"toes on fire"""" - memory issues: short term memory loss, poor spelling, not remembering where things are (everything has to be in their place) Despite all he has been through, he has been on top of his health care and is seeing various specialists: Neuro: taking gabapentin for neuropathy and TBI (current dose: 600 -300 - 600 ) Proctologist: referred after urgent care visit in june. said the surgeon said would likely need surgery as saw something, but would like MRI first which is pending GI: , for esophageal dysmotility . planned for a procedure to fix this. has been getting c-scope every 3 years d/t hx polyp - but now deferred with VA as going to be getting workup with new proctologist Cardiology: UC Davis previously, at UCSD La Jolla . pain management: appt next week for back and neck. He has been using CBD creams which have been helpful. Is considering using THC as well. Works to eat healthy and be active and have a good quality of life. Had spent about 30 years incarcerated, will be out for 3 years in February. Is active in his church. Is a big believer of vaccines and preventative care.

We discussed Post Covid Syndrome and how there is still so much we are learning and to be learned about this condition. It has a large spectrum of disease and there is not one medication/ intervention that can be done for all at this point. However, his concerns are not falling on deaf ears and we will work to hopefully get them feeling better. We discussed that Part of the challenge with long covid is that we do not have a complete grasp on the pathophysiology of it. If we can better delineate that, our hope is that we can have a better idea on how to manage it all. At this time , a couple of the main staples in care includes symptom management and to rule out any other possible etiology contributing to the symptoms one is experiencing. That being said, he is very well hooked into care. The neuropathy of his feet seem to be bothering him somewhat. Discussed that he could consider going up on his gabapentin - but he would like to do it step by step. Also wants to focus on the rectal issue/ MRI first. Also reviewed that there is evidence that repeat covid infection can cause flairs. That being said, covid therapeutics are in a much different place compared to a few years ago with his initial illness. and if he were to get sick, to contact us so we can discuss antiviral therapy. We also reviewed preventative medicine and he plans on getting the updated booster and flu shot when available. We will keep intermittent follow up to check in and hopefully provide new insight and updates.

Also remembers feeling short of breath. feels never fully recovered from covid illness, but breathing issues persisted (but everything else resolved): described as feeling short of breath, as if can't take deep breath, and chest tightness. Had been tried on various inhalers , currently on QVar which is helping. Only taking the Qvar as needed. Had been it needing it more frequently but now not needing it as much. no history of smoking tobacco or other substance no known occupational exposure. Has not been working for past 5 years, but previously worked in maintenance. Furthermore, has had had issues with sleeping - which has been going on for a long time (pre-covid illness). Denies snoring, but feels he has woken up gasping for air. When asked about daytime sleepiness he says """"always"""". but not to the point where he falls asleep while watching TV or reading. No history of PFTs. He had done sleep apnea test in Boston, Massachusetts - never got the results. said that was in 2012. Is following with MH who is also trying to help with his sleep, but also he is working with the mental health providers because he feels he """"can't be around people"""". Says this is also something htat he has been experiencing for years, but maybe was more exacerbated with the covid pandemic.

We discussed Post Covid Syndrome and how there is still so much we are learning and to be learned about this condition. It has a large spectrum of disease and there is not one medication/ intervention that can be done for all at this point. Part of the challenge with long covid is that we do not have a complete grasp on the pathophysiology of it. If we can better delineate that, our hope is that we can have a better idea on how to manage it all. At this time , a couple of the main staples in care includes symptom management and to rule out any other possible etiology contributing to the symptoms one is experiencing. I am happy to hear that he is noting improvement and that he feels his symptoms are being managed with the inhaler. I suggested further workup that could be done would include things like a sleep study and PFTs. He declined at this time, but if he doesn't continue to improve, will consider it down the line. He would like to keep focusing on his care with Mh which I agree is very important. Will plan on following up with patient in a few months time to see how he is feeling and progressing, sooner as needed.

Ended up going to ED because felt short of breath. She said that she was told there were other emergencies and for her to go home. Did not take any covid specific treatment - took acetaminophen and ibuprofen. In June 2022 she started having worsening cough. Said there was a lot of phlegm, of many different colors, and to the point where she felt like she was choking on it. In Dec 2022, said the phlegm became more grey in color and consistency was like plastic. Other associated symptom includes headache, feeling congested. Couldn't sleep due to this and the cough. Also from coughing so much she developed urinary incontinence and is now going to pelvic floor therapy. In Jan 2023, she said she again went to ED due to coughing so much and felt she coudln't breath. Was told by ED they coudln't see her. She went to urgent care. There she was told her tonsils were inflamed (?had streph pharyngitis) and they gave medication. After receiving antibiotics she has felt improved, but then would have shortness of breath and cough again. because of this pattern she feels her immune system is weak. She had f/u with PA Lopez and he gave her an inhaler. Said she was prescribed an antiallergy medication from urgent care which helped her breath but that she had bad side effects including headache, nightmares and panic attacks. Other medication she has tried is robitussim and loratadine, which have helped but she is currently out. Also has tried home remedies including echinacea. She gets scared from the coughing attacks - because they can't stop and she feels she gest asphyxiated. She worked at a Kid's Club at a gym, but her hours have been decreased to only 3 hours 3x a week due to her coughing. She wants to be better and wants a 'cure'.

Concerns/Problems addressed during telemedicine visit with plan of action: Problems addressed this Visit : • Post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC) - 1398[I10: U09.9] . • Cough - 7862[I10: R05.9] . • Congestion of nasal sinus - 47819[I10: R09.81] . We discussed Post Covid Syndrome and how there is still so much we are learning and to be learned about this condition. It has a large spectrum of disease and there is not one medication/ intervention that can be done for all at this point. However, their concerns are not falling on deaf ears and we will work to hopefully get them feeling better. Part of the challenge with long covid is that we do not have a complete grasp on the pathophysiology of it. If we can better delineate that, our hope is that we can have a better idea on how to manage it all. At this time , a couple of the main staples in care includes symptom management and to rule out any other possible etiology contributing to the symptoms one is experiencing. I recommend trying to help her symptoms from various angles: decongestant, nasal spray, cough suppressant - while we investigate further with Pulm referral and further pulm testing - specifically PFTs and CT scan. Pt says she wants a cure, which I tried to express my hope to get her feeling better but also to be realistic in that we don't have a 'cure' at this time. But as above, am hopeful for new modalities/ evidence to come out to really help her return to an improved quality of life. • Consult : PULMONOLOGY (VERIFY AUTH REQUIREMENT ) [Referral Valid until 11/10/2023] Consult, Will also place pulmonary referral • Medication : Loratadine [ loratadine 10 mg oral tablet ] Qty : 30 R : 0 DEA : FV9670894 Take orally 1 daily (As Needed) • Medication : Saline Nasal Spray [ sodium chloride 0.65% nasal spray ] Qty : 1 bottle R : 0 DEA : FV9670894 Apply spray to nasal passages (As Needed) for congestion • Medication : Dextromethorphan-Guaifenesin [ dextromethorphan-guaifenesin 10 mg-100 mg/5 mL oral liquid ] Qty : 120 mL R : 0 DEA : FV9670894 Take orally 10 mL every 4 to 6 hours (As Needed) For cough.

JOSEPH'S HEALTH CARE LONDON INITIAL CONSULTATION DATE: December 11th, 2023 LOCATION: Post-Acute COVID-19 Clinic PATIENT IDENTIFICATION: Mr. is a pleasant 47-year-old gentleman who was referred to the Post-Acute COVID-19 Clinic by Dr. Rubina Malik for the assessment of Post-COVID Condition (PCC) SOCIAL HISTORY: Mr. lives alone in London, Ontario. He has partial custody of his child from a previous marriage. He works as an engineering technician. Mr. has a 15-pack-year smoking history.

He endorses slight lightheadedness lying to sitting HEENT: minimal clicking felt on palpation over the left temporomandibular joint Respiratory: Mr. was speaking in full sentences. He had no increased work of breathing, and his lungs were clear with good air entry bilaterally. No cough present Cardiovascular: s1/s2 normal with no additional heart sounds appreciated. Pulse strong and regular. No peripheral edema noted. Apical HR 68 bpm Musculoskeletal: normal gait. Normal power and range of motion to lower extremities. Strength equal bilaterally. No edema, swelling, or erythema to bilateral knees, ankles, wrists, fingers. No tenderness on palpation of the joints. Integumentary: varicose veins to bilateral lower legs/ankles ACTIVE ISSUES DISCUSSED TODAY: Today I met with Mr. due to his concerns of brain fog and arthralgia, after what he presumes to be a COVID-19 infection in May, 2023. His acute symptoms began as profound fatigue, generalized join pain, and a loss of taste and smell. Due to the loss of his taste and smell, he believes he contracted COVID, however, he did not have access to confirmatory testing. He is not aware of any close contacts or have a recent travel history at that time. He states the peak of his symptoms lasted for ""a few days"", in which he was not able to get out of bed or go to work, but after approximately 2 weeks, he had ""80-90% improvement"", with the exception of his arthralgia. He describes his arthralgia as a constant pain, rated 2-3/10. Upon further probing, he feels his pain may be worse at night, as he is unable to sleep supine, and feels he has to shift sleeping sides often due to pain which begins in his shoulder and radiates down his arm and into his hand. He does have a documented history from 2011 of likely ""mild early carpal tunnel syndrome"". He states this has worsened over time, especially after his [presumed] COVID infection. He does state his carpal tunnel pain is discernable from his new onset of pain he has been experiencing since May, 2023, which he describes as his joints ""feeling bruised"". He has occasionally had times where his knees buckled on him slightly when walking, but denies any falls. He also states he has had more difficulty kneeling to standing - now requiring support to stand, which prior to May, 2023 he could kneel to stand independently, without an aid. He does find a few hours of relief with the use of ibuprofen. He has not tried heat or cold therapy. He was going to the gym in June and was able to do an approximate 30-minute workout, but became easily fatigued so he no longer participates in physical activity. Ethan does not recall exercising having a positive or negative impact on his joint pain. He also denies any morning stiffness. Lastly, he describes jaw pain, and hears a ""clicking"" in his neck when moving from side to side. He has been advised by his dentist that he has mild attrition secondary to bruxism. Upon physical exam today, there was only minimal clicking felt on palpation of the left TMJ. Palpation of the posterior neck with movement was unremarkable. Ethan states his jaw pain is often associated with popping in his ears, and occasionally radiates into the back of his neck and into his shoulders. He does have a history of Eustachian ear dysfunction, with tubes inserted (right ear more bothersome than left). Regarding his brain fog, Mr. tells me this symptom only presented in the ""past few months"". He describes difficulty with spelling, grammar, and transcribing of numbers, as well as he now has to write everything down, which is interfering with his job as an engineering technologist. He also shared with me over the past year he has dealt with some significant life events, such as the end of a 12-year relationship in February, 2023, the passing of his mother in July, 2023 (via MAID), and his daughter moving out for university this past fall. In reflection of these events, Mr. does not feel they have had an impact on his symptoms. Overall, Mr. states his mood has been good and he does not have concerns. He is looking forward to his trip to Italy with his daughter December 16th - 24th, 2023. ASSESSMENT: In summary, Mr. is a 47-year-old COVID-19 survivor, who has been struggling with 7 months of arthralgia and approximately 3 months of brain fog after what he presumes to be a COVID infection in May, 2023. I am uncertain at this time if his symptoms are related to Post-COVID Condition, due to lack of confirmatory testing during symptom onset, in addition to his brain fog presenting greater than 2 months post presumed infection. However, there is currently no diagnostic test available to confirm a diagnosis. PATIENT IDENTIFIED GOALS: Brain Fog Arthralgia PLAN: Brain Fog: I have sent a referral to Parkwood Post-Acute COVID-19 Rehabilitation for OT supports. I have also encouraged good sleep hygiene. Arthralgia: Ethan has had his rheumatoid factor and ANA tested twice, both times these results were negative. As such, this is unlikely to be related to an autoimmune condition (however, his father had ulcerative colitis). He does find relief with the use of ibuprofen; therefore, I will order imaging of the joints (shoulders, wrists, hands, hips, ankles, feet) to look for osteoarthritis. A requisition has been faxed to London X-Ray & Associates to be completed by Ethan at his earliest convenience (recent x-ray of knees shows minimal early degenerative changes in the right knee). I have also sent a referral for a repeat EMG. FOLLOW-UP: 2-3 months in person Repeat LFTs Thank you, Dr. Malik, for referring Mr. . It is my pleasure being involved in his COVID-19 care.

She denied any dizziness or lightheadedness · Respiratory: Stephanie was speaking in full sentences. She had no increased work of breathing, and her lungs were clear with good air entry bilaterally. No cough present · Cardiovascular: s1/s2 normal with no additional heart sounds appreciated. Pulse strong and regular. No peripheral edema noted. ACTIVE ISSUES DISCUSSED TODAY: Today, I met with Mrs. regarding her COVID journey since her infection in December 2020. She was initially seen by Dr. Abdul-Karim in the LUC3 clinic and presented with dyspnea at rest, cough, presyncope, palpitations, abdominal pain, nausea, reduced appetite, and a loss of taste and smell. She was treated with dexamethasone due to suboptimal oxygen saturations, but did not require admission to hospital or supplemental O2. Since this time, she has experienced ebbs and flows in her symptomatology, which she tells me always comes in clusters and will occur during periods of exhaustion. She states that prior to her COVID infection, she experienced a lesser degree of fatigue and difficulty sleeping, while caring for her palliative mother. During this time, she also lost both of her dogs within a short time span of one another. Stephanie feels that after her mother's passing, she was able to have more of a routine and was beginning to sleep better and get her energy back. However, shortly thereafter she contracted COVID and has not felt the same since. Today, her most bothersome symptoms are: dizziness, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, dyspnea with smoke/scent exposure, anosmia, and an exacerbation of her left shoulder and right hip pain. She denies and slips, trips, or syncope related to her dizziness. She has not experienced this for some time and states it can come on suddenly. Orthostatic vitals were completed today which were normal and not indicative of autonomic dysfunction. I have advised her to ensure adequate hydration and to avoid driving if she is feeling dizzy that day. Regarding her sleep, she states she struggles with falling asleep, but not staying asleep. She is currently sleeping approximately 8-9 hours per night, but does not wake up feeling rested. She takes a CBD gummy before bed which she finds helpful. She denies any snoring or wakening gasping for air. Concerning her hip and shoulder pain, she tells me she had x-rays and ultrasounds completed which were normal and showed no evidence of a tear (I do not have access to such imaging). She also complains of acute on chronic low back pain, which she states will flare during stressful times in her life. She does admit that she is currently under a lot of stress, which is typical for her during the holiday season, as well as a new uncertainty as to what will happen in the spring with her job, as Brescia is closing. She was reluctant to fill out her PHQ-4 today, as she felt her mood today was not reflective of her average mood. Nevertheless I did encourage her to complete it to the best of her ability, and reinforced that it was to capture a moment in time and would repeated on subsequent visits. Although she scored 9/12 on her PHQ-4, she did not have concerns regarding her mood. I discussed with Stephanie the results of PFTs, which may be suggestive of small airway disease. Given her extended second-hand smoke exospore, as well as new onset chest pain and dyspnea to scent and smoke exposure, I have offered her a trial of Symbicort. She was amenable to this. Lastly, her main concern today is her persistent anosmia. I discussed with Stephanie a newer procedure for parosmia/anosmia using a stellate ganglion block (SGB), as it has been showing some good outcomes. She is aware this procedure is still in its infancy stage and that I am uncertain at this time if she is a candidate, but if interested, I would refer her for further assessment and discussion. Mrs. was amenable to this; I have provided her with some resources on the procedure. ASSESSMENT: In summary, Mrs. is a 54-year-old COVID-19 survivor, who over the past three years has struggled with a cluster of symptoms, which are likely comparable to Post-COVID Condition. However, there is currently no diagnostic test available to confirm a diagnosis. PATIENT IDENTIFIED GOALS: v Dizziness v Fatigue v Difficulty Falling Asleep v Dyspnea v Anosmia v Hip/Shoulder Pain PLAN: 1. Fatigue/Dizziness: I have sent a referral to Parkwood Post-Acute COVID-19 Rehabilitation to be assessed for OT/PT/SLP/SW supports. She will also participate in COVID-101 starting in the new year, which is a 7-week virtual educational series focusing on lifestyle modifications for post-COVID/query PCC patients. Educational handouts were also provided. 2. Dyspnea: I have e-faxed a prescription to Turner Drug Store for Symbicort 1 puff BID plus 1 puff BID PRN (max 8/24 hr). I will repeat her PFT's in 3-4 months' time. She was given one Symbicort sample inhaler (200 mcg-6 mcg) to take home with her today, as well as education and demonstration were provided by nursing staff. 3. Anosmia: I have faxed a referral to Dr. Geoff Bellingham to assess Stephanie's candidacy for possible stellate ganglion block 4. Difficulty Falling Asleep: Sleep hygiene handout provided and recommended use. May also try over-the-counter Melatonin 5 mg. 5. Mood: Mental health resource pamphlet and crisis support line provided 6. Arthralgia: I have recommended heat/cold therapy, over-the-counter rubs (Voltaren, A535, etc.), acetaminophen/ibuprofen as directed on the bottle. I also discussed safety and short-term use of Robaxacet. FOLLOW-UP: 3-4 months in person ü Repeat full PFTs Thank you, Dr. Horne, for referring Mrs. . It is my pleasure being involved in her COVID-19 care. Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our clinic.

PATIENT IDENTIFICATION: Ms. Katie is a pleasant 37-year-old female who was referred to the Post-Acute COVID-19 Clinic by Dr. Stacey Snider for the assessment and treatment of Post-COVID Condition (PCC). She was accompanied today by her parents Dave and Wendy. SOCIAL HISTORY: Ms. lives at home in Wellesley, Ontario with her daughter and son, ages 17 and 14 years, their 2 dogs, and their cat. Prior to her COVID-19 infection, Ms. was self-employed, working full-time hours as a housekeeper. However, she is now being supported financially through CPPD, due to what she believes is post-COVID sequelae. Ms. is current smoker with a 6-pack/year history. She smoked a ½ pack per day from age 20 to 28, quitting in 2014, and began smoking again 1 pack/day since 2021.

No peripheral edema noted. · HEENT: inspection, palpation, and auscultation of the neck were unremarkable ACTIVE ISSUES DISCUSSED TODAY: Today, I had a lengthy discussion with Katie and her parents regarding her COVID timeline. Her parents were very active in our discussions. Katie tells me she first contracted COVID on March 27th, 2023 which was confirmed via PCR testing. Her initial symptoms presentation was worsening of headaches, sore throat, fever, tinnitus, twitching, and vertigo. She describes her tinnitus as ""screaming"". However, her mother also added that at times Katie would tell her she was hearing voices in her head, and her mother commenting ""I thought she may have been going crazy or was becoming schizophrenic"". When I asked Katie to clarify, she said ""it sounded like voices, or someone calling my name, but this doesn't't happen anymore, now I just hear screeching tires"". I also inquired if there is any family history of schizophrenia or mental health disorders, which they denied. Furthermore, Wendy shared with me that she was concerned about Katie's mood, and that since her COVID infection, both she and her husband have been taking turnings staying over at Katie's house, as she will call them in the middle of the night stating ""I can't do this anymore"", ""I don't want to be here anymore"", or ""I am afraid if I go to sleep I won't wake up"". I clarified with Katie if her fear of not waking up was due to feelings of wanting to harm herself, or was it due to experiencing thoughts of impending doom; which she responded with the latter. Regarding her thoughts of ""I don't want to be here anymore"", Katie denied any active homicidal or suicidal thoughts. She has had passive suicidal thoughts, without a plan. Her most recent thoughts were approximately 1-month ago. I discussed with Katie and her parents the importance of reaching out to a crisis line should she have these thoughts, especially with a plan. I also offered her a referral to Ontario Structured Psychotherapy West Region (OSP West), for counselling services, which she was amenable to. Regarding her sleep, Katie tells me she can go ""days"" without sleeping. I asked about any history of snoring, which she and her father endorsed. She also has twitching in her legs overnight and does not find her sleep to be refreshing. She also states she has woken in the middle of the night ""in the middle of a snore"". She denies any history of sleep apnea or having a sleep study in the past. Today, Katie continues to struggle with tinnitus, sinus pressure, headaches, fatigue, and brain fog. She does have a long-standing history of migraines and facial pain in the trigeminal region, which was assessed by neurology and trigeminal neuralgia was ruled-out. However, she states that her migraines, vs facial pain, vs. sinus pressure are discernable from one another, and her sinus pressure is new since her COVID infection. She was prescribed a nasal spray in the past due to CT findings of post-inflammatory changes within the paranasal sinuses, but she found no effect. As such, I offered a referral to ENT, which she was agreeable to, and requested to see someone in Stratford. I also had further discussions with Katie around headache medication over-use, due to the amount of ibuprofen she is currently taking. I reviewed the results of her PFTs with the 's, which Katie scored 3 out of 4 for a possible upper airway obstruction. Katie denies any dysphagia, lumps, or vocal cord dysfunction. She does endorse a globus sensation and occasional cough with clear sputum. I have recommended to move forward with a CT neck and chest to rule out anything sinister, which she was amenable to. I have ordered this to be completed at SJHC and they are aware should there be any abnormal findings within the upper airway, it would be further evaluated by ENT, whom she has already been referred to for her other symptoms. Lastly, I discussed with the 's our Post-Acute COVID-19 Rehabilitation Program at Parkwood hospital, in addition to our virtual education series. Katie agreed to a referral as well as participating in COVID-101 in the new year. ASSESSMENT: In summary, Ms. is a 37-year-old COVID-19 survivor, who struggles with a constellation of symptoms which may be comparable to Post-COVID Condition vs chronic sinusitis vs. a combination of the two. However, there is currently no diagnostic test available at this time to confirm a diagnosis. As such, she should first be assessed by ENT for assessment and treatment of other possible etiologies. PATIENT IDENTIFIED GOALS: v Fatigue v Brain Fog v Headaches v Sinus Pressure v Tinnitus v Mood PLAN: 1. Fatigue/Brain Fog: I have sent a referral to Parkwood Post-Acute COVID-19 Rehabilitation to be assessed for OT/PT/SLP/SW supports. She will also participate in COVID-101 starting in the new year, which is a 7-week virtual educational series focusing on lifestyle modifications for post-COVID/query PCC patients. Additionally, I have sent a referral to Peak Sleep for a sleep study and Sleep Specialist consultation for query sleep apnea, which may be a contributing factor. Educational handouts were also provided. 2. Headaches: I have provided Katie with handouts related to medication over-use headaches, as well as a 3-month headache diary she should complete. Should she have no improvements in her headaches, I would recommend trialing a headache preventative. Typically, adequate trials are considered 2-3 months in duration at therapeutic doses (i.e. Amitriptyline, propranolol, or topiramate), if there are no other formal contraindications to these medications. Should these be inadequate, I would recommend a referral to Dr. Alexander Melinyshyn, Dr. Sachiko Takahashi, or Dr. Tommy Chan. 3. Mood: With Katie's permission, I have faxed a referral to Ontario Structured Psychotherapy West Region (OSP West), who offer OHIP funded CBT support as well as self-directed learning modules. She was also provided with information on contacting the crisis support line should she have active thoughts of suicidality. 4. Sinus Pressure/Tinnitus: Due to lack of improvement with Nasonex, I have faxed a referral to Dr. Hughes in Stratford for ENT consultation. A copy of her PFTs and previous CT head were also attached. She may also trial saline nasal rinses. 5. Query Upper Airway Obstruction: I have ordered a CT neck and thorax to be completed. Should any significant upper airway findings arise, I will update Dr. Hughes accordingly. FOLLOW-UP: 3-4 months via telephone Thank you, Dr. Snider, for referring Ms. . It is my pleasure being involved in her COVID-19 care. Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our clinic.

"RESPIROLOGY CONSULTATION ( Auth (Verified) ) J754575 cc: Elizabeth Smith, Nurse Prac Shizar Goosheh Richard W. McCalden, MD FRCSC DATE OF CONSULTATION: January 5, 2024 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Elizabeth, Thank you for the kind referral of , a pleasant 78-year-old gentleman who was referred to the Long COVID Clinic for ongoing assessment of his cough and phlegm secondary to his COVID infection. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: 1. Asthma. 2. Osteoarthritis. 3. Reflux. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Arthrotec. 2. Nexium. 3. Ventolin p.r.n. ALLERGIES: No known drug or environmental allergies. FAMILY HISTORY: No strong family history of asthma, however, does have a recurrent pneumonia history that could be associated with asthma. SOCIAL HISTORY: is retired from working in the London Life offices. He was in an office setting. He is an ex-smoker, with maybe an 18 to 20-pack-year smoking history, but quit over 35 years ago now. He is independent of his ADLs and IADLs. COVID HISTORY: describes getting his first infection after his single vaccine in March of 2021. He had his vaccine for a couple of weeks, which likely gave him a good shot at good immunity and reduced symptomatology. He described his COVID infection as being quite mild with just some sniffles, mild cold with sore throat. He denies any fevers, headaches or impressive productive cough. He then describes unfortunately classic postviral infection asthmatic symptoms of cough, chest tightness and shortness of breath for about 5 months post. Sounds like he might have trialed some inhaler therapy at that point, but I am not exactly sure. He still continued to have lingering fatigue that has also been affected maybe by his sleep pattern alternation. He feels like he is thirsty and often waking up at night due to this thirst. He denies any postnasal drip symptoms or reflux outside of when he misses his medication. He also notes a nocturnal cough when he misses his reflux medications. Right now he describes a bit of dry phlegm and a dry cough more often than not. Again, it is occasionally nocturnal, but not consistently enough. He has no aspiration events or concerning features. He denies any lower limb edema as well. He denies any presyncopal symptoms or palpitations. He also denies any neurological symptoms. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well, in no distress. He was saturating 96 on room air. Blood pressure is 139/72 with a heart rate of 67 beats per minute. Respiratory exam revealed diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheeze throughout all lung fields bilaterally. There are no crackles noted. He was not clubbed peripherally. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function test today interestingly showed a restrictive pattern. His ratio was 82 with an FVC of 75% predicted or 2.79 litres. FEV1 was 82% or 2.30 litres. TLC was restricted at 78% with a DLCO that was normal at 73% predicted with a DL/VA at 109%. Overall, this suggests an extraparenchymal restriction. Blood work today during clinic showed an elevated IgE at 185 with an eosinophil count of 0.6. This is indicative of inflammatory asthma or type 2 asthma. Chest x-ray was unremarkable with no evidence of active disease. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a 78-year-old who likely has uncontrolled asthma based on his symptomatology and his blood work. I have given him a trial of the Trelegy 100 mcg dosing just to see if once a day works well for his day-to-day life. He was amenable to doing this. We will see him back in about 3 months' time to see how he is doing on the inhaler therapy with suggestions that we could alter this to involve something different. He is not sure Symbicort helped him in the past, so I do not think we jump to that just yet. Alternative options for him could include a short course of steroids and/or even biologics going forward. We will wait to see what we do with his inhaler options. Yours sincerely, Michael J. Nicholson, MD Division of Respirology"

I am assessing her today for her long COVID symptoms specifically. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: 1. Vocal cord polyps with previous abnormalities. Recent scope shows no evidence of polyps at this time. 2. ? asthma. 3. ? POTS syndrome. 4. ? ADHD versus chronic fatigue. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Modafinil. 2. Tylenol p.r.n. 3. Vitamin B12. 4. Rabeprazole. 5. Ventolin p.r.n. 6. Incruse Ellipta. 7. Symbicort. ALLERGIES: Allergies to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, codeine, and possible environmental. SOCIAL HISTORY: is a nurse in the Respirology unit at Victoria Hospital. She is a lifelong nonsmoker. COVID HISTORY: Unfortunately, was infected with COVID, possibly from a work exposure at the end of 2020. She has been dealing with long COVID symptoms since. She has described classic symptoms for POTS as well as ongoing issues with easy fatigability and cough with dyspnea. She has had multiple inhaler trials and it sounds like she is currently on Symbicort and Incruse as her options that best suite her. Unfortunately, the other big thing that is struggling with the use of an N95 mask at work. It sounds like it is giving her some troubling symptoms, which is never good. She has had some work related work-around, which is good to hear that they are accommodating her, but she is still struggling in it is consistent use. We had a good chat about further workup and rehabilitation program that would be eligible for. At the early stage of her recovery, she was not eligible for rehab program because she was filtered through WSIB rehab pathway. I informed her that, that often is not the best route and was not often managing long COVID patients with the same requirements that they were getting with our excellent collaborations and colleagues at Parkwood. was interested and thankful for this ability to see them over at Parkwood and I will make the referral. I also think she would benefit from a tilt table test, for which I will arrange through our program at Parkwood. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: is impressively tachycardic here resting in clinic at 111 beats per minute. She was saturating 100% on room air with blood pressure 132/81. INVESTIGATIONS: Full PFTs are completely normal. Her ratio was 92, with an FEV1 of 92% predicted or 3.30 litres. TLC is normal at 98 with borderline normal RV at 120 and DLCO 103. Chest x-ray performed prior to clinic was normal. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 33-year-old nurse, who is suffering from long COVID symptoms, on multiple levels including likely POTS and excessive fatigue. I have asked her to join our excellent COVID Rehab program over at Parkwood in addition to undergoing a tilt test. I have not made arrangements for her in our Long COVID Clinic here at St. Joe's and she had already has an excellent colleagues of mine involved in her care. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

"RESPIROLOGY CONSULTATION ( Auth (Verified) ) J1084459 cc: Sachiko Takahashi Mario F. Elia DATE OF CONSULTATION: January 5, 2024 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Sachiko: Thank you for the kind referral of back to our long COVID Clinic. She was assessed by myself again after I last saw her in July of 2022. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: 1. Asthma. 2. Depression. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Symbicort. 2. Query venlafaxine. ALLERGIES: Environmental including ragweed, pollens, grass, dust and smoke. SOCIAL HISTORY: Unfortunately, is not currently working as a teacher. She has been off on long-term disability. She is considering going back to teach soon. COVID INTERVAL HISTORY: really describes having ongoing brain fog with fatigue that lasted about 18 months or so. She was actually just referred over to my colleague, Dr. Takahashi for ongoing issues of neurological concerns including dizziness. She was still describing that in addition to brain fog, confusion, word finding difficulty and feeling as though her time continuum is off filter. This has definitely occurred over the past 12 months or so, but recently might have improved just a few weeks ago. It sounds like she had COVID a few weeks ago and ended up having a prescription for Paxlovid provided. Things were really looking to help her with the Paxlovid not only for the acute infection, but interestingly, had a bit of an improvement in some of her brain fog and confusion symptoms. She still describes a lot of dysfunction with regards to time and space, but otherwise has improved since the Paxlovid. This is interesting to note as this has been found in certain patient populations in long COVID therapy. Her inhaler use has been a little bit more frequent as of her COVID infection, but otherwise, really has not had a concern for any worsening exacerbations or phenotypes of exacerbations such as nocturnal symptoms, chest tightness or wheeze. Overall, she does feel like she is stable on an as needed plan with respect to her asthma. We had a good chat about some of the neurological testing that she performed actually with our psychologist, Dr. Rennison. I will obtain that information on 's behalf and send it over to Dr. Takahashi's office. I think this would be helpful for part of the workup. I note there are some other lingering concerns with Dr. Takahashi. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well, in no distress. She was saturating well on room air at 100%. Blood pressure and heart rate were normal. INVESTIGATIONS: PHQ-4 questionnaire was 4/12. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 46-year-old lady who is still struggling with her long COVID symptoms. I will obtain some of the information for Dr. Takahashi to sort through. I have asked her to reach out if she would like to return back to the post-COVID program again at Parkwood as she did find it helpful. She was thankful for this and will let me know. I have not made arrangements for followup, but again, we will be happy to see her again if the need arises. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

Van Koughnett, MD MEd FRC DATE OF CONSULTATION: January 5, 2024 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Dr. Despard: Thank you for the kind referral of , a pleasant 45-year-old lady, who was referred to the Long COVID Clinic for assessment of her long COVID symptomatology. I saw her today in consultation. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: 1. Asthma (intermittent inhaler use). 2. Environmental allergies. 3. Lymphocytic colitis secondary to biopsy diagnosis in May 2021. 4. Migraines. 5. Reflux. 6. Tubal ligation. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Amitriptyline. 2. Blexten. 3. Budesonide capsules. 4. Ketorolac p.r.n. 5. Maxeran p.r.n. 6. Magnesium hydroxide p.r.n. 7. PEG p.r.n. 8. Ranitidine at bedtime. 9. Ventolin p.r.n. ALLERGIES: 1. Environmental allergies. 2. Wool, shellfish and lanolin. SOCIAL HISTORY: is currently a cigarette consumer. She has mild consumption, but is still actively smoking. At most, she has about a 10-pack-year history. She is currently not employed. She has no gait aids or assistance devices. FAMILY HISTORY: Interestingly, has a strong family history of COPD in multiple smokers in her family. COVID HISTORY: describes having COVID in April of this year. She states that this was really a mild case so to speak. Unfortunately, she has had a multitude of symptoms post COVID that is really consistently bothered her. It sounds very much all postnasal drip and upper airway cough syndrome (UACS). She has trialled Symbicort 8 times a day without any helpful improvements. She states that she did use it when she was sick with COVID, but after that has not found it beneficial. She did find it beneficial with COVID. She is only using Ventolin as needed right now. With respect to her lingering symptoms, is really postnasal drip sounding with nocturnal cough as well as an early morning only cough. Throughout the day, it is much improved. She describes some cough and phlegm being milky and thicker, but again relinquishing throughout the day. She has some occasional discolouration, but it has not had any blood in it. She denies any epistaxis or hemoptysis. She actually went on a cruise in August and September and felt like her symptoms were no better being away from her environment here. She still has ongoing postnasal drip symptoms, but does use over-the-counter antihistamines and finds that occasionally helpful. She has also noticed a lot of dry throat and hoarseness with some occasional cough and phlegm that is occurring. Again, this sounds like it is related to her upper airways. The only other long COVID symptoms that she is still describing right now are some neurological issues like word finding difficulty and some brain fog. I do wonder if she would benefit from seeing our long COVID rehab colleagues, but I am not sure she fills that bill just yet. I think if we can improve some of her upper airway cough symptoms first, she might have some overall improvements. She was amenable to trying this. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well, in no distress. She was saturating 98 on room air. Blood pressure and heart rate were within the normal range. INVESTIGATIONS: Full pulmonary function testing for today is completely normal. Ratio was 81 with an FEV1 of 120% predicted at 3.68 litres. TLC was normal at 125, an RV of 133, which were all elevated, but within the normal range for her as she has upper limit of normal testing results. DLCO was normal at 114. Chest x-ray performed prior to clinic is completely normal. There are no abnormalities found. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a 45-year-old patient with what sounds like upper airway cough symptoms right now. I think she would benefit from ongoing upper airway management with some Avamys nasal sprays. I had drawn some blood work as well today to assess for any atopic features right now. If her long COVID brain fog and confusion does not improve soon in the next couple of months, we will send a referral over to our rehab colleagues to help her. She was amenable to this. We will see her back in 4 months or so to see how she is doing on the therapies. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

Fraser, MD, FRCP(C DATE OF CONSULTATION: January 5, 2024 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Dr. Sun: Thank you for the kind referral of to the long COVID Clinic for assessment of her long COVID symptomatology. She is currently being assessed for the eligibility of COVID rehabilitation. I saw her today in consultation along with her partner. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: 1. Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis. 2. Query idiopathic intracranial hypertension/pseudotumor cerebri syndrome. 3. Depression. 4. ADHD. 5. Reflux. 6. Chronic pain. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Escitalopram. 2. Pantoprazole. 3. Prazosin. 4. Vitamin D3. 5. Topiramate. 6. Eye drops. 7. Tylenol Extra Strength p.r.n. ALLERGIES: No known drug or environmental allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: is currently not employed. She does smoke marijuana daily. She uses a bong. She is an ex-smoker with a remote mild smoking history in her teenage years. She has 3 children. FAMILY HISTORY: No obvious pulmonary family history. There is coronary disease in her family. COVID HISTORY: had her first COVID infection in October 2021. At that point, she was only vaccinated with one vaccine in August of 2021. She has only ever received one vaccine. She had symptoms of cough, sore throat, fevers and then developed a rash, numbness and paresthesias. Her cough was dry and nonproductive. She then developed symptoms in November 2021 of the idiopathic intracranial hypertension as well as some left more so than right-sided hearing loss and balance issues. She felt like her brain was ""on fire"" and she had impressive brain fog. She has really had no obvious asthma symptoms and despite using a bong consistently for her marijuana, she states she always has a clean water. She uses her husband's rescue inhalers as needed that is really inconsistent with frequent use. Her long COVID symptoms are still dealing with potentially multi organs. She describes palpitations and issues with presyncope. She states she has symptoms that are worse with standing. She also has ongoing headaches. She has had some repeated infections, where she was PCR positive in November 2022 where she had some peripheral and central cyanosis, but was not hospitalized for this. She has not necessarily had much in the way of pulmonary symptoms that have lingered outside of some occasional palpitations and shortness of breath on exertion that might be cardiac in nature. She has impressive features of sleep apnea with sleep changes and frequent awakenings. She also describes some choking with sleep and some excessive daytime somnolence. Her biggest concern is related to ongoing paresthesias, vibration issues and temperature changes in her sensory system. She has also had some eye twitching and vision issues where she has noticed some problems with focusing. She does use glasses, but has not described migraine symptoms such as photophobia or aura/floaters. She was a bit perplexed about everything that has been happening as it has not been a unifying diagnosis. She is interested in joining our COVID Rehab Program, which I think would be very reasonable; however, I think she also would benefit from an assessment from a neurologist who has taken an interest in this. I think she would benefit from a tilt table; however, I am not completely sure as to what the restrictions would be from a weight perspective as she is 135.9 kilograms. I will reach out to Dr. Bhangu for this. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: did not appear in any distress here today in clinic. Her vital signs were stable, saturating 98% on room air. She was tachycardic at rest at 102 beats per minute. Blood pressure was 124/81. INVESTIGATIONS: Chest x-ray performed prior to clinic is completely normal. There is no abnormalities within the pleural or parenchymal spaces. Full pulmonary function tests are normal with a ratio of 80 and an FEV1 of 105% predicted or 3.43 litres. DLCO is normal as well as TLC at 111. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a 36-year-old long COVID patient who would benefit from a few further assessments including tilt table testing for POTS as well as an assessment from our neurologist, Dr. Takahashi who is interested in long COVID patients like this with multiple symptomatology. We will make a referral over to our COVID Rehab program as well as Dr. Takahashi and check in on the requirements for the tilt table testing. I had not made arrangements for followup with , but we will call her if any blood work abnormalities arise on today's testing. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

She denied any dizziness or lightheadedness. She had an abnormal steppage gait bilaterally with ambulation · Respiratory: Mrs. was speaking in full sentences. She had no increased work of breathing, and her lungs were clear with good air entry bilaterally. No cough present · Cardiovascular: s1/s2 normal with no additional heart sounds appreciated. Pulse strong and regular. No peripheral edema noted. · HEENT: bilateral scleritis, blepharitis, scaly patches to sides of nose and eye lids. PERRLA. · Musculoskeletal: abnormal gait - high stepping/neuropathic gait · Integumentary: ?blepharitis/seborrheic dermatitis ACTIVE ISSUES DISCUSSED TODAY: Today I met with to discuss her COVID journey with her. She tells me her symptom onset began on May 6th, 2023 and she had a positive home rapid antigen test on May 9th, 2023. She was treated with Paxlovid from May 10th to May 14th, 2023. Her acute symptoms were ""cold-like"", with a runny nose, cough, congestion, chest pain, and dyspnea. As these symptoms began to resolve, she started developing severe bilateral foot pain ""like a knife under my skin"". She describes this pain to be located to the lateral aspect of the plantar foot which is worst when she is first standing, especially if she had her feet previously elevated. This pain can occasional radiate up to her ankles. She states she is no longer able to walk in bare feet, but does wear her orthotics, which she finds to be helpful. She denies any redness or swelling. She also describes having ""heavy legs"" and states ""my legs don't feel normal anymore...I have to think in order to walk"". She denies any slips, trips, or falls. Additionally, she complains of dyspnea, however, this is a longstanding symptom which precedes her COVID infection, for which she was seen by Dr. Mackenzie. states this symptom was improving in September, 2023, but has recently re-emerged over the last month with exertion. I performed spirometry on her today which was normal. Another symptom she has been experiencing is chest pain, which she describes as ""her chest in a vice"". I inquired if anything makes this better or worse, which she said she will take a Rolaids and it will resolve. Moreover, she had a 2x4 installed under the head of her bed, which has also improved her symptoms. I wondered if she has a known history of GERD, which she denies, however, I did advise that based on her symptom improvement with an antacid and elevating the head of her bed, GERD was the likely underlying cause. But, due to her being on Prolia injections for her osteoporosis, I will leave the initiation of a PPI in the capable hands of Dr. Spence. In the interim, I have asked her to continue using her Rolaids PRN. Fourthly, she was concerned with the rash on her face and eyelids, in additional to red itchy dry eyes, stating it has been present for the last month. She also complains of changes in her vision since the rash has progressed, finding her vision to be blurrier. She has not been seen by her Optometrist, as she is not due with coverage until the late spring. However, I did recommend she call and be seen earlier, although it may be out of pocket. However, given the numbness and tingling she is feeling in her feet and being prediabetic, I educated on the risk of diabetic retinopathy, which would be unlikely at this time given her A1C has been stable around 6.0-6.1% since 2018, however, it would be important to have her eyes evaluated, as damage is irreversible. I also took a moment to educate on what it means to be ""prediabetic"" and the hemoglobin A1C. I advised her that lifestyle changes were the best way to control blood sugars and that with a 10% weight loss she would significantly reduce her risk of be becoming diabetic. In addition, a 10% weight loss would improve her blood pressure and cholesterol, as well as reduce stress on her joints. I have recommended this be done through diet and exercise, which she has access to a Registered Dietician through her Family Health Team. I have encouraged her to book an appointment with the RD to discuss her diet. Moreover, tells me she is currently walking 3000 steps/day. I have advised her that adults should be aiming for 10,000 - 15,000 steps/day, which may not be achievable for at this time given her foot pain. As such, I have asked her to focus on the impact a change in diet can make on weight loss, as well as glucose control. was amenable to this. With regards to her facial rash, this is a recent symptom which would be unrelated to post-Covid (presented > 3 months post-COVID infection), therefore I was unable to address this concern during our time today. However, I have asked her to follow-up with Dr. Spence for ?blepharitis. This may also be related to her query Sjogren's, which is being followed by Dr. Tom Appleton. She states she is currently using Benadryl with some effect. Lastly, asked about the safety of the new XBB COVID vaccine and if it was recommended, as she was concerned her sister had a reaction to the vaccine and therefore was hesitant. states she has had no adverse reactions to her previous vaccines, which have all been Pfizer. As such, I had assured she was unlikely to experience any adverse effects with a subsequent dose, but, did inform her that there have been a few of our Post-COVID Condition (PCC) patients report a worsening of their symptoms for approximately 2 weeks time. Conversely, some PCC patients saw slight improvements in their condition post-vaccine. Nevertheless, given 's age and current medications, and with respect to the increasing rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations, and subsequent infections worsening PCC symptoms, I shared with that in my medical opinion the potential risks did not outweigh the known benefits, therefore, I would recommend she receive the new XBB vaccine, which was available from Pfizer or Moderna. Mrs. inquired if she could receive the Pfizer vaccine today, as such, the Prescription Shop was contacted and they were able to schedule for her Pfizer vaccine today, which she was agreeable to. ASSESSMENT: In summary, Mrs. is a 79-year-old COVID-19 survivor, with bilateral foot dysesthesia/paresthesia, post COVID infection May, 2023. I am uncertain at this time if this symptom is secondary to Post-COVID Condition vs another underlying cause i.e. peripheral neuropathy. However, there is currently no diagnostic test available to confirm a diagnosis. PATIENT IDENTIFIED GOALS: v Foot Pain/Numbness v ""Heavy Legs"" v Shortness of Breath on Exertion v COVID Vaccine PLAN: 1. Dysesthesia/Paresthesia/""Heavy Legs"": was previously seen by Dr. Azarpazhooh who planned on consulting with the Neuromuscular Clinic. I have also sent a referral for an EMG due to her steppage gait, which was not noted previously by neurology. I have also encouraged to speak with the registered dietician from her Family Health Team for education on prediabetes, as her condition may worsen if her blood sugars increase. However, her A1C has been stable since June/2018, most recently 6.1% (Nov/23). 2. Dyspnea: She was seen by Dr. Wong through London Cardiac Institute who completed a comprehensive work-up with no significant findings. Additionally, according to her history, 's dyspnea began prior to her COVID-19 infection. Although she has a minimal past smoking history, she had significant exposure to second hand smoke in the household from infancy to age 49. Her FEV1/FVC ratio today is stable, but borderline normal (71%). She was seen previously by Dr. Mackenzie for her dyspnea, first in November, 2020, and most recently in October, 2021, but no underlying cause was found. Her FEV1/FVC ratio was 70%. Interestingly, 's PHQ-4 score today was 0, however, I did not find her mood to be congruent with this, as she was closed off, short-spoken, and at times, defensive. I believe she is at risk for anxiety and depression secondary to social isolation and chronic pain; she also lives alone. As such, Dr. Spence, 's mood may need to be further explored as a possible contributing factor, ideally by someone whom she has a stronger therapeutic relationship with than myself. Additionally, you may consider re-referring her to Dr. Mackenzie, as there has been a change since she was last seen in October, 2021. However, I will leave these recommendations to your capable discretion, as this symptom precedes her COVID-19 infection. FOLLOW-UP: 3-4 months via telephone Thank you, Dr. Spence, for referring Mrs. . It is my pleasure being involved in her COVID-19 care. Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our clinic. Sincerely, Mariah Mariah Zalitach, MN NP-PHC Post-Acute COVID-19 Clinic St. Joseph's Health Care London"

ACTIVE ISSUES DISCUSSED TODAY: I met with Mr. today to discuss his COVID-19 journey with him. tells me he was first infected with COVID-19 in early 2021, which was positive via a home rapid antigen test (RAT). He was symptomatic for a short time and his symptoms fully resolved. However, on September 1st, 2022, he contracted a subsequent COVID infection. It first presented as flu-like symptoms, headache, fevers, and worsening fatigue, where he was unable to get out of bed for two days. Over time, his flu-like symptoms resolved, however, his headaches and fatigue improved only minimally. He also developed what he describes as ""travelling pain"", which is a pain that persists in a joint for approximately 4-5 weeks at a time, then travels to another unrelated joint. He describes his pain as a dull ache, and denies any redness, swelling, or rashes to the area. He has some relief with massage therapy and osteopathy, as well as his CBD/THC oil. He also has moderate effect from acetaminophen and ibuprofen use, but reserves this for when the pain is severe. In terms of his headaches, he states they are isolated to the back of the head and neck, and can be relived with CBD/THC oil. Occasionally he will use ibuprofen or acetaminophen for abortive therapy. I discussed with the possibility of medication over-use headaches and provided him with resources. I also provided him with a headache diary to be completed. I asked about any jaw pain or history of night grinding, which he states he does grind at night, but wears a night guard for this. He feels this would be unrelated to his headaches as his grinding began before his COVID infection, while headaches presented after. I discussed with headache red flags of when to be seen urgently, i.e. worst headache of his life, a headache that wakes him from his sleep, thunderclap headache, etc. He denies any red flags at this time. Regarding his fatigue, this has been an ongoing concern which precedes his COVID infection. However, he feels his post-COVID fatigue is different than before, as it is so severe he is now napping during the day, anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour. This is in addition to his 8 hours of sleep. He denies any snoring or gasping for air when sleeping, however, he finds his sleep unrefreshing and has persistent daytime sleepiness. I see that a sleep study was completed in 2018, due to his previous history of daytime sleepiness and unrefreshing sleep, for which he was seen by Dr. Kashgari and no treatment was advised at that time. However, due to his worsening fatigue, he was re-referred to Blue Water Health for a follow-up sleep study, which was schedule for December, 2023, but, was unfortunately cancelled due to the recent cyber-attack. He was not provided with a rescheduled appointment date. As such, I encouraged to reach out to determine the status of his test and also provided Mr. with a copy of his sleep study from 2018 to provide to Blue Water Health for comparison, should he be rescheduled. Alternatively, he can be re-referred to Dr. Kashgari if the status of his sleep study at Blue Water Health remains unknown. has also been struggling with brain fog, such as issues with both short-term and long-term memory, as well as occasional word finding difficulties. He does not find himself to be forgetful, but does acknowledge he has always been someone who writes everything down. I asked if his family have mentioned they have noted any changes in his memory or language, which he denies. However, he shared that on multiple occasions, his family has noticed a change in his mood, specifically apathy. has also noticed this about himself, stating that he ""used to care about decisions he made, but now he is indifferent"". He acknowledged that his apathy has had a negative impact on his family, therefore it is important to him he receives help. He denies any homicidal or suicidal thoughts. I discussed the Ontario Structured Psychotherapy Program (OSP West), which is a program that offers OHIP funded CBT support, as well as self-directed learning modules, which Mr. was amenable to a referral. ASSESSMENT: In summary, Mr. is a 55-year-old COVID-19 survivor, who struggles with a constellation of symptoms, which either began post- COVID-19 infection, or became exacerbated post-infection. It is difficult at this time to discern if his symptoms are a result of Post-COVID Condition (PCC), an alternative underlying aetiology, or a combination of both, as there is currently no diagnostic test available to confirm a diagnosis. However, his cluster of symptoms are commonly seen in PCC, therefore, we will treat it as such, while ensuring alternative contributing conditions are ruled-out. PATIENT IDENTIFIED GOALS: v Fatigue v Brain Fog v Headaches v Mood/Apathy v ""Travelling Pain"" PLAN: · Fatigue/Brain Fog: I have sent a referral to Parkwood Post-Acute COVID-19 Rehabilitation to be assessed for OT/PT/SLP/SW supports. He was interested in participating in COVID-101, which is a 7-week virtual educational series focusing on lifestyle modifications for post-COVID/query PCC patients. Additionally, he is awaiting his sleep study to be reschedule at Blue Water Health; it is unclear when this will occur due to the recent cyber-attack. However, he had a previous sleep study completed at Victoria Hospital in 2018 where he was seen by Dr. Kashgari. I have provided him with a copy of this to bring with him to his upcoming sleep study for query sleep apnea, which would likely be a contributing factor. Educational handouts on sleep hygiene were also provided. · Headaches: I have provided with handouts related to medication over-use headaches, as well as a 3-month headache diary he should complete. Dr. Marcoud, should have no improvements in his headaches, I would recommend trialing a headache preventative. Typically, adequate trials are considered 2-3 months in duration at therapeutic doses (i.e. Amitriptyline, propranolol, or topiramate), if there are no other formal contraindications to these medications. Should these be inadequate, I would then recommend a referral to Dr. Alexander Melinyshyn, Dr. Sachiko Takahashi, or Dr. Tommy Chan. · Mood/Apathy: had concerns today regarding his mood and apathy, therefore I have faxed a referral to OSP West with 's consent. He was also provided with our mental health pamphlet containing various mental health resources within the community and region, along with Reach Out and the new 988 crisis support numbers. · Travelling Pain: Continue with non-pharmacological treatments, such as massage therapy, cold/heat therapy, osteopathy, etc. May also try over-the-counter rubs, such as Voltaren, A535, etc. He is aware to monitor how much ibuprofen and acetaminophen he uses to ensure he does not experience medication overuse headaches. · Vitamin D Insufficiency: Vitamin D level today was 50 nmol/L. was amenable to supplementation, therefore I have e-faxed a prescription for cholecalciferol 1000 iu, BID to Shoppers Drug Mart in Grand Bend. I will repeat this value during his next visit. 3. Work Accommodations: I understand that has been working full-time since his COVID-19 infection. However, I discussed with him the option for work accommodations, as we have seen that any reduction in our patients work schedules have been beneficial in reducing their symptomatology. Often, our patients are most successful remaining off work/under accommodations until they have completed their COVID-101 educational sessions, and commenced their one-to-one rehabilitation sessions, where they can be further evaluated and considered safe to return to work. I explained to this was not a decision he needed to make today, however, I asked him to take some time to think about it more and to speak with his family. I encouraged him to reach out to our clinic if he had any questions. Dr. Marcou, should Mr. be amenable to accommodations, I would recommend one of the following: 1. Medical Leave of Absence x 3 months then re-assess, 2. If wishes to remain working, but would like accommodations, I have provided an example of some accommodation recommendations below, which you can evaluate on a monthly basis until he is seen by the Post-Acute COVID-19 Rehabilitation Program (approx. 4 months' time), who will modify his accommodations thereafter: · 4-6 hour shifts, 3 days/week, with a day off between working days · When possible, he should keep work hours consistent (i.e. all mornings or all afternoons) · Flexibility within his day to ensure adequate breaks (i.e. 5-minute break every 1- hour, 30-minute break between classes, 5-minute breaks between meetings/appointments, etc.) · Privileges to turn off camera while using online platforms, to reduce stimulus · Private/quiet work environment · Working from home privileges, when appropriate · Extensions on deadlines · No medical notes required for intermittent absences · Flexible work hours to accommodate medical appointments/rehabilitation · Mr. 's workload expectations/demand under these aforementioned accommodations should not exceed the equivalent of part-time hours FOLLOW-UP: 3-4 months in-person ü Repeat vitamin D level Thank you, Dr. Mackenzie, for referring Mr. . It is my pleasure being involved in 's COVID-19 care. Should you or Dr. Marcou have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our clinic.

No cough present during her exam · Cardiovascular: s1/s2 normal with no additional heart sounds appreciated. Pulse strong and regular. No peripheral edema noted. ACTIVE ISSUES DISCUSSED TODAY: I met with and her mother today from 0900 hr - 1015 hr to discuss her symptom timeline. was referred to our clinic, to assess if her symptoms were related to Post-COVID Condition (PCC). I shared with Ms. and Mrs. that there is currently no diagnostic test for PCC, therefore a diagnosis can only be made based on a thorough medical history in addition to our expert clinical judgement. She understood this. According to the referral sent to us from Dr. Sinclair, had a COVID-19 infection on January 20th, 2021, which was confirmed via a rapid antigen test RAT). However, shared with me that she believes she contracted COVID in the New Year of January, 2022, and confirms she never completed a PCR or RAT test. When I clarified what was written on her referral, she tells me she has never had a positive COVID RAT test, nor does she believe she had COVID in 2021. But, she states she had antibody testing completed in March, 2022 at Dynacare, which was positive; unfortunately, I cannot find this result in OLIS and was not able to provide me with this result today during her appointment. I have asked if she locates this result (states it was sent to her via e-mail), to please forward it on to our clinic. Regarding her symptom history, endorses her symptoms presented sometime in early January, 2022 with sore throat, dry cough, runny nose, muscle fatigue, severe headaches and fevers. Her acute symptoms lasted for approximately 2 weeks, however her headaches persisted. Again she did not have any confirmatory testing completed to confirm COVID-19 vs. another upper respiratory virus (i.e. influenza, RSV, etc.). Today, I inquired what Ms. 's most bothersome symptoms were, which she states 1. Fatigue, 2. Shooting pains, and 3. Headaches. With further exploration, confirms her fatigue began prior to January, 2022, but worsened thereafter. She also recalls her shooting pains began in the spring of 2023, but admits that for the year of 2022 she was ""numb from her PTSD"" and ""disconnected from her body"". Lastly, her headaches have persisted since January, 2022 stating ""they are constant and never go away"". Regarding her fatigue, she tells me she has ""insomnia"" and ""cannot fall asleep"". However, she sleeps 7-8 hours every night, which is typically uninterrupted, but ""may wake up once""; since starting her antidepressant; she has had marked improvement in her sleep, but continues to describe it as ""unrefreshing"". I do note she had a sleep study completed which shows mild positional sleep apnea, and a tonsillectomy was recommended. Due to her extensive history, is being followed by Registered Psychotherapist Maribel Ayala for EMDR therapy on a weekly basis. She has been previously followed by psychiatry (most recently Dr. Aiswarya), with no current follow-up appointment booked, but, was encouraged to reach-out should she feel one is required. In terms of her shooting pains, she describes ""electroshocks"" behind her ears and in her head, which radiate down her spine and into her pelvis. They are worsened with eating, and resolve on an empty stomach. She denies any abdominal pain. She also stated this symptom improves with the use of clonazepam and magnesium, but does not find relief with the use of over-the-counter analgesics. Additionally, she is being followed by a physiotherapist in the community for her pain, which she has also found helpful. Lastly, she describes her headaches as a constant pain between her eyes, temples, and back of the head. Ibuprofen/acetaminophen have been ineffective. Her recent MR head shows nonspecific white matter lesions in the supratentorial brain and right globe esotropia for which she was referred to neurology (has not yet received an appointment date or time), as well as she was seen by Ophthalmology on January 4th, 2024 for an orthoptic exam, however, these paper-based results were not available for me to review at the time of this note. Heather also mentioned has been referred to Dr. Shehla Chaudhry LMC London, which she is scheduled to be seen on January 24th, 2024 to complete a dexamethasone suppression test, due to elevated cortisol levels (751 Jun/23) and associated dizziness. ASSESSMENT: In summary, Ms. is a 28-year-old woman with a newly confirmed history of COVID-19 infection, date unknown. Her referral to the Post-Acute COVID-19 Clinic was due to concerns of fatigue, headaches, and neuropathy ""since COVID-19 infection January, 2021"". However, Mrs. denies having COVID in 2021, though believes she had a COVID infection at the beginning of January, 2022. Unfortunately, there are many inconsistencies between her documented history, vs. the history I received today from and her mother, making it difficult to discern if her symptoms presented before, or after an unconfirmed COVID-19 infection. In addition, there is no diagnostic test available to make a diagnosis. As such, based on Ms. 's current available history, I am reluctant that say her symptomatology is secondary to Post-COVID Condition. Nevertheless, focus should remain being directed toward the treatment of her individualized symptoms. PATIENT IDENTIFIED GOALS: v Fatigue v Headaches v Neuralgia PLAN: 1. Fatigue/Chronic Pain: With 's consent, I have sent a referral to Parkwood Post-Acute COVID-19 Rehabilitation for to participate in COVID-101, which is a 7-week virtual educational series focusing on lifestyle modifications for post-viral condition related symptoms. Educational handouts were also provided. Her positional sleep apnea may be a contributing factor. She was recently switched from Cipralex to Pristiq, which she notes her clonazepam and antidepressants have improved her pain; I wonder about possible Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS) rather than Post-COVID Condition. She is currently being followed by physiotherapy with some effect on her chronic pain. She also has a consultation with endocrinology for elevated cortisol levels. 2. Headaches: Has been previously referred to neurology for this concern as well as abnormal MRI results. I have also provided Ms. with handouts related to medication over-use headaches, as well as a 3-month headache diary to complete. Should she see no improvements in her headaches, I would recommend trialing a headache preventative. Typically, adequate trials are considered 2-3 months in duration at therapeutic doses (i.e. Amitriptyline, propranolol, or topiramate), if there are no other formal contraindications to these medications. Should these be inadequate, I would then recommend a referral to Dr. Alexander Melinyshyn, Dr. Sachiko Takahashi, or Dr. Tommy Chan. FOLLOW-UP: 4 months in person Thank you, Dr. Sinclair, for referring Ms. . I will arrange one additional follow-up with her in approximately 4 months' time, however, I do not feel strongly with 's current history that her symptoms are due to Post-COVID Condition. Nevertheless, it is my pleasure to be involved in her COVID-19 care. Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our clinic.

Unfortunately, these were ineffective, therefore she booked a subsequent telephone follow-up, where she was prescribed a subsequent course of antibiotics, again, without effect. states her ear pain and headaches continue to persist today, and are associated with subjective hearing loss in the right ear. On December 20th, 2022 while she was driving her car going to work, she suddenly felt that she was unable to see from her right visual field. She denies any occurrence of curtain-like falling down or scotoma that enlarged in size. There was no association of scintillating fortification or color visual spotting. This lasted for approximately one minute and she did not try to close each eye to figure out if it was monocular or binocular vision loss. When she arrived at work, she called her husband, who picked her up and drove her to the ED, where a CT scan and lab tests were completed with no acute findings. She was subsequently discharged with an urgent referral to the TIA clinic and was given a prescription for Tramacet for her headaches and Aspirin 81 mg for stroke prevention. Unfortunately, the TIA clinic clinic could not confirm if her symptoms were secondary to a TIA, but suggested should continue on a full stroke prevention regimen including low dose ASA and the statin, so long as she was not experiencing stereotypically recurrent visual symptoms, allowing for a definitive diagnosis of migraine auras. Mrs. was later seen in consultation by Dr. Markovic in the Neurology Clinic regarding her symptoms of headache, disorientation, and sensitivity to complex environments following her RSV and COVID-19 infection in November of 2022. She was started on Gabapentin, which has found to be mildly helpful providing about a 20% relief. Dr. Markovic suggested that she continue on it for the time being and concomitantly started her on amitriptyline. In regards to her other symptoms, his recommendations were pacing and a referral to the Post-Acute COVID-19 Program, where she was previously declined due to her TIA work-up. Dr. Markovic felt a TIA was a probable incidental finding and not related to her overall symptoms. In follow-up with Neurology on January 3rd, 2024, stated she was tolerating her amitriptyline well as a daily preventative headache medication and it has helped significantly with her sleep. She endorses marked improvement in her headaches, including right-sided head pressure, and brief shooting pains. However, she continues to have low tolerance to situations such as complex stimulating environments, i.e. being in a busy mall or hosting more than a couple people over at her house, as overstimulation triggers her headaches and makes it difficult for her to concentrate. John also notes an obvious increase in stumbling on her words in over stimulus environments. Fortunately, Mrs. 's previous MRI of the head did not show any structural abnormality, and her tympanometry in August, 2023 showed normal hearing bilaterally, (albeit, Mrs. continues to endorse subjective right hearing loss), but her test did show she has some auditory processing difficulties with speech and background noise; she is awaiting consultation with ENT. Today, does not feel she has had any changes in her symptoms since she was last seen by neurology on January 4th, 2024. She was relieved to hear that planning and pacing has been the consistent recommendation from multiple healthcare providers, myself included. I informed and her husband about our Post-Acute COVID-19 Rehabilitation Program, which she was amenable to a referral. I did explain to Mr. and Mrs. that it is difficult to confirm if her symptoms are truly related to Post-COVID Condition, due to the lack of confirmatory testing, however, based on her current symptomatology, I believe she would benefit from our rehabilitation program. Before the end of our appointment today, inquired about any known side effects to the Shingles vaccine related to her symptoms. I did emphasize that for anyone receiving the Shingrix vaccine, it is not unusual to feel temporary side effects such as mild fever, muscle aches, fatigue, etc. for 2-3 days. With respect to any known side effects the shingles vaccine could have on her current symptoms, there were none. However, I shared that some PCC patients have reported a temporary setback in their symptoms for approximately 2-weeks time after a COVID vaccine, therefore it would not be unreasonable to caution the same may be true with Shingrix. Nevertheless, I stressed to them that the known benefits largely outweigh the small potential risks. ASSESSMENT: In summary, Mrs. is a 56-year-old COVID-19 survivor, who struggles with a constellation of symptoms for which she was seen in clinic today. It is difficult at this time to discern if her symptoms are a result of Post-COVID Condition (PCC), an alternative underlying aetiology, or a combination of both, as there is currently no diagnostic test available to confirm a diagnosis. However, her cluster of symptoms are commonly seen in PCC, therefore, we will treat it as such, underscoring that alternative contributing conditions should continue to be further assessed and/or ruled-out. PATIENT IDENTIFIED GOALS: v Fatigue v Post-Exertional Malaise v Brain Fog v Headaches PLAN: 1. Fatigue/PEM/Brain Fog: I have sent a referral to Parkwood Post-Acute COVID-19 Rehabilitation to be assessed for OT/PT/SLP/SW supports. Mrs. was also interested in participating in COVID-101, which is a 7-week virtual educational series focusing on lifestyle modifications for post-COVID/query PCC patients. Educational handouts were also provided. 2. Headaches: has had improvement since starting Amitriptyline in late November/early December, 2023 (she delayed starting this medication due to her recent knee surgery). She began noticing positive effects approximately 2 weeks ago. She is also on gabapentin, a current dose of 300 mg capsule which she is tolerating well when taken at bedtime. I have no further recommendations at this time. 3. Work Accommodations: I understand that Mrs. has been off work since her COVID-19 infection in November, 2022 under Long-Term Disabilities. I discussed with her and her husband that often, our patients are most successful in reducing their symptomatology by remaining off work until they have completed their COVID-101 educational sessions, and at minimum commenced their one-to-one rehabilitation sessions. This way, our rehab team can further evaluate to ensure she is safe to return to work, with a graduated return to work plan in place. 4. Vitamin D Insufficiency: Prescription for cholecalciferol 1,000 iu BID with food e-faxed to SDM Huron Heights. Will repeat at next visit. FOLLOW-UP: 3-4 months in person ü Repeat Vitamin D at next visit Thank you, Dr. Thompson, for referring Mrs. . It is my pleasure being involved in her COVID-19 care. Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our clinic. Sincerely, Mariah Mariah Zalitach, MN NP-PHC Post-Acute COVID-19 Clinic St. Joseph's Health Care London"

She denied any dizziness or lightheadedness during our time together. However, she did experience some lightheadedness during her PFTs. · Respiratory: was speaking in full sentences. She had no increased work of breathing, and her lungs were clear with good air entry bilaterally. No cough present · Cardiovascular: s1/s2 normal with no additional heart sounds appreciated. Pulse strong and regular. No peripheral edema noted. ACTIVE ISSUES DISCUSSED TODAY: Today I had a lengthy discussion with regarding her symptom timelines. She tells me after her first COVID vaccine in May, 2021, she began experiencing dizzy spells, syncope, and fatigue. Her fatigue has continued to persist, and has become increasingly worse since February, 2023, in addition to new onset chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, reduced taste, neck and ear pain, and spots in her vision. She tells me it was her chiropractor who identified they believe her symptoms are in-keeping with post-COVID condition, which she had not thought of before but realized she has a history of a positive COVID test ""mid-November, 2022"". She further shared that one day while she was working out, she experienced an episode of ""10/10 chest pain"", for which she presented to the Emergency Department. She tells me since this event that she has had hypertension, persistent headaches, and spots in her vision. Due to these symptoms, she was referred to urgent neurology, however, she declined her appointment as she had to travel to visit her mother. As such, she was never re-booked. However, she was assessed by her optometrist who told her exam was normal, that what she was experiencing were floaters. Today, Ms. continues to struggle with fatigue, headaches, intermittent cough, and reduced taste. She was started on rizatriptan for her headaches, which she states has good effect. She is currently using it 3-4 times/week for abortive therapy. Regarding her fatigue, she tells me she used to workout 7 days/week, but due to her fatigue has cut-back to 4 times/week for 1-hour durations. Her cough is intermittent without any known triggers. It does not occur at any particular time of the day. She states occasionally she will cough so hard, she ""coughs up green""; she denies any hemoptysis. Lastly, she states since COVID she had reduced taste, describing all her food as ""bland"". I provided with a 3-month headache diary and asked her to begin tracking for any provoking or alleviating factors, as well as every time she is using her rizatriptan. She tells me she is drinking ""a ton"" of water every day to ensure she is hydrated. I also offered a referral to our program's education series, which is a 7-week virtual program that focuses on lifestyle modifications for those suffering with post-viral condition. She was amenable to a referral. Lastly, I discussed with Ms. a procedure called a Stellate Ganglion Block (SGB), which has shown some effect in helping patients regain taste and smell post COVID. Moreover, she understands that a SGB for the purpose of post COVID hypogeusia is still within its infancy, and is not currently a standard recommended treatment. As such, I did emphasize that if she did agree to a referral today, it would be to speak with the specialist regarding the procedure, but I could not guarantee she is an appropriate candidate. was amenable to a referral; therefore, I provided her a handout on SGBs. She understood she may not qualify for this procedure. ASSESSMENT: In summary, Ms. is a 44-year-old COVID-19 survivor, who struggles with a constellation of symptoms which may be more in-keeping with post viral syndrome secondary to Lyme disease vs SARS-CoV2. However, there is currently no diagnostic test available to confirm a diagnosis. PATIENT IDENTIFIED GOALS: v Fatigue v Brain Fog v Vision Changes v Headaches v Cough v Hypogeusia PLAN: 1. Fatigue/Brain Fog: Positive Lyme Tic bite June, 2021, around the same time her symptoms began. As such, post viral condition secondary to Lyme Disease is high on the differential. With her consent, I have sent a referral for to participate in COVID-101 through our Parkwood Rehabilitation Program, which is a 7-week virtual educational series focusing on lifestyle modifications for post-viral conditions. Educational handouts were also provided. 2. Visual Changes: Was seen by her optometrist and told her optometric assessment was normal and spots were floaters 3. Headaches: I have provided Ms. with handouts related to medication over-use headaches, as well as a 3-month headache diary she can complete. Should she have no improvements in her headaches, I would recommend trialing a headache preventative. Typically, adequate trials are considered 2-3 months in duration at therapeutic doses (i.e. Amitriptyline, propranolol, or topiramate), if there are no other formal contraindications to these medications. Should these be inadequate, I would then recommend a referral to Dr. Alexander Melinyshyn, Dr. Sachiko Takahashi, or Dr. Tommy Chan. 4. Cough: CXR and PFTs normal. Possibly ACE-I induced dry cough (unclear how long she has been on this medication - she states cough began after her COVID infection). I suggested she trial a teaspoon of pasteurized honey, as honey has demulcent, antioxidant and antibacterial effects 5. Hypogeusia: Referral sent to Dr. Geoff Bellingham to assess if Ms. is an appropriate candidate for a Stellate Ganglion Block. 6. Vitamin D Deficiency: Prescription for cholecalciferol 1,000 iu, BID e-faxed to Village Pharmacy, Milverton. I will also fax a post-dated lab requisition to LifeLabs in Stratford for a repeat Vitamin D level. I have asked to complete this 2-weeks before our next scheduled appointment which will be in approximately 3-4 months' time. 7. Borderline Hemoglobin: does not endorse any known active sources of bleeding. She denies hemoptysis, BRBPR, melena, or menometrorrhagia since her Mirena insertion. Will repeat a CBC with her next follow-up. TEST DATE RESULT Hemoglobin 2024/01/22 112 g/L Hemoglobin 2023/02/27 121 g/L Hemoglobin 2023/02/21 148 g/L Hemoglobin 2021/09/22 116 g/L Hemoglobin 2021/06/08 118 g/L Hemoglobin 2021/04/13 122 g/L Hemoglobin 2021/03/29 113 g/L Hemoglobin 2019/04/26 115 g/L FOLLOW-UP: 3-4 months via telephone v Repeat Vitamin D & CBC (lab req faxed to LifeLabs, Stratford) Thank you, Dr. Cookson, for referring Ms. .

That evening, she went to the gym, where she had a sudden onset of floaters in her eyes, headaches, dizziness, tinnitus, and profound fatigue. She remembers spending the next three days being unable to get out of bed. She was treated at that time for a sinus infection, and was given a course of amoxicillin, which had no effect. From this point forward, her symptoms have not ceased. As such, she has been unable to return to work, and is currently being supported through long-term disability with Desjardins. Regarding her fatigue, I discussed with her previous health history in July, 2021 where she was being seen by a resident of Dr. Zafar's for history of 2-3 years of debilitating fatigue. She was also being treated at this time for iron deficiency, with a ferritin of 8, and possible physiologic fatigue secondary to not having taken a break from work for more than 2 years. She was started on iv iron infusion therapy, but unfortunately had a severe reaction, therefore she is on oral iron supplementation, which she is tolerating well. It is noted by Dr. Zafar that was also reporting mild tension headaches 5-6 times per month. I discussed these findings with in relation to her presenting complaints today, which she states her fatigue then versus now is quite different and had a distinct onset post-COVID infection. Due to her aforementioned symptoms, Ms. reached out to Cornerstone Physiotherapy in Toronto, who have a program dedicated to Long-COVID, as she believed this was the cause of her concerns. She had x3 virtual appointments with Vaidehi Patel, RPT. I was able to receive a copy of these notes; upon review, was diagnosed with POTS (albeit, this was done virtually through her Fitbit and there was no blood pressure monitoring during her stand test, nor were any symptoms documented during the test). She was recommended sodium loading 4-5 grams salt/day or 2 grams sodium. She was also suggested uptime intervals of a maximum of 10 minutes standing every 1 hour, and for every 50 minutes of sitting, she should be supine for 10 minutes. Additionally, they recommended 30-40 mmHg compression stockings, and 2.5-3 litres of water intake/day. tells me she has had improvement in her heart rate spiking since implementing these suggestions. Moreover, Ms. was seen by Dr. Devendra Bhatt from the Ontario Heart Centre, which I was also able to obtain a copy of her cardiac work-up, which was unremarkable. She has a follow-up scheduled sometime in July, 2024. also started seeing a naturopath, who started her on a variety of natural health products. Of significance, Ms. has noted marked improvement in her fatigue, mood, and cognition since starting 5-HTP. She also states that her dizziness has been well controlled on Nicotinamide. She does not have a follow-up booked with her naturopath, due to the cost. Currently, her energy levels wax and wane. She feels her energy has an inverse relationship to the amount of physical and cognitive energy she expends, stating if she takes on too much in one day, she will end up ""crashing"". This is very characteristic of post-exertional malaise syndrome (PEM), which is common in patients with Post-COVID Condition. She is currently able to walk for 30 minutes 2-3 times per week, but her walks occasionally lead to a crash. Prior to her COVID infection, she enjoyed reading, but tells me she has not been able to read since march as it can also lead to a crash. Regarding her headaches, she states they are accompanied with constant tinnitus. She has been taking large amounts of ibuprofen daily, as it provides good effect for abortive therapy. I did educate on medication overuse headaches as well as being mindful of the daily maximum amounts of ibuprofen to be taken in a day, and to not take them on an empty stomach due to risk of ulcers. Lastly, she complains of ""floaters"" in her eyes, which do not correspond with her headaches. She denies any changes in clarity of her vision or accommodation near to far. She regretfully has not seen her optometrist for this issue, which I have encouraged her to do so. She apparently had an MRI head completed at GNMI in Toronto, which I am not able to access, but have requested a copy with her consent. ASSESSMENT: In summary, Ms. is a 42-year-old COVID-19 survivor, who struggles with a distinct exacerbation of fatigue and headaches post COVID-19 infection in March, 2023. Although her symptom timeline is not classic of Post-COVID Condition, as onset precedes her infection, she does endorse a typical cluster of symptoms that are seen with this condition. Unfortunately, there is currently no diagnostic test available to confirm a diagnosis, however, we will proceed treating it as such, while continuing to rule out other possible aetiologies. PATIENT IDENTIFIED GOALS: v Fatigue/PEM v Headaches v Tinnitus v Arthralgia v Insomnia PLAN: 1. Fatigue/PEM/Brain Fog: I have sent a referral to Parkwood Post-Acute COVID-19 Rehabilitation to be assessed for OT/PT/SLP/SW supports. She is no longer being followed by Cornerstone Physiotherapy. Ms. was also interested in participating in COVID-101, which is a 7-week virtual educational series focusing on lifestyle modifications for post-COVID/query PCC patients. Educational handouts on sleep hygiene were also provided. 2. Headaches: I have provided Ms. with handouts related to medication over-use headaches, as well as a 3-month headache diary she should complete. Should she have no improvements in her headaches, I would recommend trialing a headache preventative. Typically, adequate trials are considered 2-3 months in duration at therapeutic doses (i.e. Amitriptyline, propranolol, or topiramate), if there are no other formal contraindications to these medications. Should these be inadequate, I would then recommend a referral to Dr. Alexander Melinyshyn, Dr. Sachiko Takahashi, or Dr. Tommy Chan. 3. Insomnia: previous sleep study unremarkable for sleep apnea. Sleep Hygiene handout provided. 4. Suboptimal Ferritin: Ferritin today is 44.6; target is >50 to avoid symptoms associated with iron deficiency. I have encouraged her to continue her Feramax daily. 5. Query POTS: I have sent a referral to Dr. Jaspreet Bhangu for a tilt table test to confirm dysautonomia/POTS. Although her stand test from Cornerstone Physiotherapy does show a > 30 bpm increase in HR for more than 10 min, a diagnosis of POTS also requires the blood pressure to remain stable (<20 mmHg drop in SBP or <10 mmHg drop in DBP), as well as the patient must be symptomatic whilst standing. Her orthostatic vitals today were not in keeping with POTS, however, she has been on sodium tablets for some time now, which may be helping to control her spikes in heart rate. FOLLOW-UP: 3 months in person Thank you, Dr. Ferenc, for referring Ms. . It is my pleasure being involved in her COVID-19 care. Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our clinic. ** 09:30 hr - 09:45 hr: Ms. consented to participate in the Long COVID-Optimize study conducted through Lawson Research, whereby she completed surveys via a tablet provided to her by a member of the research team. Two additional sodium citrate tubes were also drawn by nursing staff, with Ms. ' consent.

"RESPIROLOGY CONSULTATION ( Auth (Verified) ) J1586749 cc: Daniel L. Pepe DATE OF CONSULTATION: February 2, 2024 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Dan. Thanks for the kind referral of , a pleasant 55-year-old gentleman, who was referred for long COVID symptoms based on a prolonged set of post-COVID breathing difficulties for more than a year now. I saw him today in consultation. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: 1. Reflux. 2. Query asthma. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Pantoprazole daily to b.i.d. 2. Omnaris nasal spray p.r.n. 3. Pulmicort p.r.n. 4. Ventolin p.r.n. ALLERGIES: Query environmental allergies. No known drug allergies. FAMILY HISTORY: Strong family history of asthma in both his mother and son. SOCIAL HISTORY: is a nonsmoker. He is quite active with work and extracurriculars. He is a school board member. COVID HISTORY: Unfortunately, he had COVID in September 2022 where he felt mildly ill with the acute infection, but since then has had a significant impact on his breathing. He states that his symptoms when he was sick were classic COVID with rhinorrhea, cough, phlegm and a fever. He did describe some exertional dyspnea and at rest dyspnea that did extend into the first month after his COVID infection in September 2022; however, worsened for the better part of the year. He states that he used Symbicort for a bit and has found that helpful. It also is potentially that he was using Pulmicort, but nevertheless had improvements in this. Feels like he had Symbicort use up to 3 times a day that seemed to be helpful. We had a good chat about potential asthma in his family history, therefore in his potential medical history. He was not premature nor did he have any asthma diagnoses before today. I am not really sure he has asthma per se based on this one time episode of having irritation post-COVID, but it definitely could fit the pattern. He states in the last 3 to 4 months, he has really turned the corner and has actually weaned off his inhaler therapy as he seems much better now. This is good to see. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well, in no distress. He was saturating well on room air at 98%. Blood pressure and heart rate were normal. INVESTIGATIONS: Full PFTs performed today are completely normal. His ratio was 85 with an FEV1 of 98% predicted or 4.09 litres. TLC was 92 with an RV of 113. His diffusion capacity was 118. Overall, these are normal. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 55-year-old gentleman, who had post-COVID dyspnea that was initially severe post an acute infection in September 2022 prompting a V/Q scan in October 2022. It was negative for PE, but he was appropriately treated with some Symbicort and potentially Pulmicort over the past year. This would make sense based on his family history as well as his symptomatology. He has gradually improved, which is great to see and I had a good discussion with him about tapering off the Symbicort. He was happy to do so and knows that he should initiate on something like this again if he were to get a significant viral infection that goes to his chest. He was amenable to this. I offered him a methacholine, but I do not think it is something that we need to do currently as it sounds like it might be mild asthma just based on his symptomatology post viruses. I do not want label him as this yet, but if it does happen again post virus, I think it is reasonable to obtain a methacholine or treat him on speculation. I have not made any arrangements for followup, but I did some blood work today to see if we could phenotype him. He was amenable to that. I suggested I will call him if there is a significant abnormality in his blood work, but otherwise we will leave the door open for a followup, as I have not made arrangements for follow up. Thanks for involving me in his care. Sincerely, Michael J. Nicholson, MD Division of Respirology D: February 3, 2024 T: February 3, 2024 Dictation ID: 18367234 Conf #: 3470062"
"RESPIROLOGY CONSULTATION ( Auth (Verified) ) J817892 cc: Victoria Soo, MD Chai W. Phua, MD Paula C. Donahue, MD, FRCP(C Lillian Barra, MD, FRCPC DATE OF CONSULTATION: February 2, 2024 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Dr. Soo, Thank you for the kind referral of , a pleasant 74-year-old lady, who was referred to the Long COVID Clinic for assessment of possible long COVID symptoms. I saw her today in consultation along with her husband. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: 1. Stage IV extranodal marginal zone lymphoma with previous R-CHOP therapy, giant cell arteritis (followed by Dr. Barra). 2. Hypertension. 3. Raynaud's phenomenon. 4. Hearing loss. 5. Restless leg syndrome. 6. Previous shingles. 7. Hypothyroidism. 8. Reflux disease. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Lasix 40 mg daily. 2. Pramipexole. 3. Vitamin D. 4. Synthroid. 5. Celecoxib. 6. Rabeprazole. 7. Docusate. 8. Aspirin. 9. Cyclobenzaprine. 10. Edarbi 40 mg daily. ALLERGIES: 1. Amlodipine. 2. Biaxin. 3. Diltiazem. 4. Penicillins. FAMILY HISTORY: No obvious family history of pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary diseases. SOCIAL HISTORY: is retired. She lives with her husband and is independent of her ADLs and IADLs for the most part. She does not exert herself with any additional supports. She is a lifelong nonsmoker with accumulating 3 years of smoking as a teenager, which is likely not contributory. She previously was employed as a department store clerk. COVID HISTORY: Interestingly, had caught COVID on a cruise with her husband in May of 2023. At that time, she was vaccinated with 5 vaccines. When probing a little bit further, she actually describes having shortness of breath probably back in 2018. This was first when her echocardiogram demonstrated some pulmonary hypertension. This was based on the fact that she had lower limb edema that was not otherwise classified. She describes exertional breathlessness of an MRC class 3/5 that has worsened over the past couple of months. She has also described asymmetrical lower limb edema that has been impressively responsive to Lasix. She was not sure what was really driving the bus with regards to her lymphoma diagnosis and therapy with some of her breathlessness and fatigue. I think it is very reasonable that being managed for MALT lymphoma with chemotherapy would have generated some symptoms of fatigue and breathlessness. Nevertheless, she does not endorse any constitutional symptoms now. From a risk factor perspective of pulmonary hypertension, she does have a few with some of her chemotherapy agents now, but this was identified preceding the chemo options. She does not endorse any sleep apnea symptoms nor does she endorse any issues of scleroderma outside of Raynaud's phenomenon. She has had some previous workup from the Rheumatology colleagues for the issues of GCA. Her ANA was negative many years ago. We had a good chat about how pulmonary hypertension works and effects her functionality. I suggested at this point it might be more inducible pulmonary hypertension than anything else based on echocardiogram findings and her O2 being 100%. With that being said, her pulmonary function tests were quite impressively abnormal for isolated low diffusing capacity, which would be in keeping with PH. She was thankful for this discussion and I suggested still some further investigations to perform before we look at potentially managing this. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well, in no distress. She was saturating 100% on room air. There was some asymmetrical left leg greater than right leg lower limb edema of 1+ at the ankle bilaterally. Precordial exam did reveal a mild, but soft tricuspid murmur at the parasternal border. Pulmonary exam was completely benign. INVESTIGATIONS: As mentioned earlier, old PFTs did show a ratio of 85 on spirometry with an FEV1 of 136% predicted or 2.71 litres. TLC was 116% with a DLCO of 71%. This was in keeping with an isolated low diffusing capacity. Chest x-ray performed prior to clinic shows previously seen abnormality of an opacity in the right hemithorax is now resolved. There are no other abnormalities identified on x-ray. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 74-year-old patient with identified PH on echocardiogram back in 2021 as well as 2018. I think this is likely indicative of her shortness of breath concerns as evidenced by her isolated low diffusing capacity. I do not think she actually has significant long COVID symptoms as she denies anything else with regards to her long COVID aside of breathlessness. She will have a workup with a CT PA and a repeat ANA and then I will discuss with her the results over the phone. I do not have any obvious etiologies and therefore will send her to my colleagues once these tests are performed for discussion of a right heart catheterization and potential management. She was amenable to this. We will speak to her after these tests have been done. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

"RESPIROLOGY CONSULTATION ( Auth (Verified) ) J1615974 cc: Melanie Beswick Nusrat Parveen, MD Julian Dalgliesh Winicjusz Wolski DATE OF CONSULTATION: February 2, 2024 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Dr. Beswick: Today, I saw in Long COVID Clinic assessment. She has had previous assessments by colleagues around the province for this diagnosis. She also has a mildly abnormal sleep study that could be contributing to her symptoms. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: 1. Long COVID (diagnosed in 2022). 2. Mild OSA with positive sleep study abnormalities. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Progesterone oral daily. 2. Estrogen topical p.r.n. 3. Blexten p.r.n. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. COVID HISTORY: describes having COVID in August of 2021. She was not vaccinated at that time. She has had two subsequent vaccines since. She had a significant infection where she was short of breath with cough, headache, sore throat and felt like she had limited intakes on breath. Her energy had been quite impacted and she was in bed. She really states since then, things have really not been the same. Her long COVID symptoms that she describes is fatigue, body aches, pains, brain fog, shortness of breath and headaches. She has been working with a physiotherapist closer to her house in Ancaster who sounds quite switched on and fantastic. This is great to see. She has been quite helpful with the pains and aches that she has described. The physio is also been helping her do pacing and breathing techniques. I suggested to that she is at high risk for long COVID due to her unvaccinated status as well as the fact that she has ongoing symptoms even 3 years now out. She has been using as-needed Blexten that has been helpful and she has actually made a antihistamine or low-histamine diet change that has been helpful. She is pretty sure that she would not tolerate the sleep apnea treatment options despite having a positive study. I suggested that is going to impact her long COVID symptoms, especially brain fog, headaches and fatigue as that is all associated with sleep apnea that is untreated as well. She again was hesitant to accept that as a recommendation of mine and I will leave that in the family doctor's hands. I suggested she be a good candidate for our long COVID rehabilitation program at the Parkwood Institute even though it is here in London and she lives in Ancaster. The majority of it is done virtually, but they will set up times to do in-person assessments. She was happy to hear this. SOCIAL HISTORY: is a lifelong nonsmoker, but did have secondhand smoke exposure from her father. She works at York University as a Spanish language teacher. She is currently on leave from that job. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well, in no distress. She was saturating 96 on room air. Blood pressure is 111/70 with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute. INVESTIGATIONS: Full PFTs are completely normal. Ratio was 77, spirometry with an FEV1 of 101% predicted. TLC was normal at 100% with a normal RV at 102. DLCO was normal at 86. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a 57-year-old lady who is dealing with long COVID for a few years now and has had some minimal success with her excellent physiotherapists that she is seeing closer to home. I was happy to hear this. I think she would benefit from our long COVID rehabilitation program here for further management and discussion. She was amenable to this. I have not made arrangements to see her back in clinic, but we will see her through the Rehab program virtually at Parkwood. Yours sincerely, We would highly recommend that she consider OSA therapy due to her ongoing symptoms as this might be contributing to the long COVID as well. I emphasized this a few times and we will see if she followthrough with this. Yours sincerely, Michael J. Nicholson, MD Division of Respirology D: February 3, 2024 T: February 4, 2024 Dictation ID: 18367462 Conf #: 3472512"

No cough present during her exam · Cardiovascular: s1/s2 normal with no additional heart sounds appreciated. Pulse strong and regular. No peripheral edema noted. ACTIVE ISSUES DISCUSSED TODAY: Today I had the opportunity to meet for some time with Agnes and her husband, Ian, to discuss her Covid journey. Agnes tells me she first contracted COVID on May 4th, 2022, which was confirmed via a positive rapid antigen test. Her initial symptoms were shortness of breath, fatigue, and feeling like ""a bad cold"". She denies any fevers. Her acute symptoms lasted approximately one week before she felt she fully recovered. She felt well for about a month, and was able to have her wedding and go on her honeymoon. However, shortly thereafter, she had an experience where her dogs ran loose from the house and she was chasing after them around town, causing her to become ""so short of breath she was almost vomiting""; her dyspnea was also associated with palpitations. She recalls it took her close to 3 hours before she could settle her breathing. Then again in September, 2022, her severe palpitations re-emerged, as well as symptoms consistent with presyncope, therefore she presented to St. Thomas Emergency Department. She was diagnosed with likely Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) and advised to wear compression stockings, increase her water and salt intake, as well as practice deep-breathing. Since implementing these recommendations, she has noted a reduction in her heart rate, but not in her symptoms of presyncope. Her orthostatic vitals today were not diagnostic of POTS, as her heart rate did not increase by >30 bpm, however, she has been actively treating her symptoms through conservative measures for the past year, which may reduce her heart rate spike on monitor today. Her husband also noted that Agnes has been dropping items more frequently, and ""her shirt is always wet"" because she spills on herself so much when drinking from her water bottle. I asked Agnes if she agrees with this, and she felt she has been having more difficulty with her grip strength recently, but also states she has a new hand tremor that may also be contributing. But, Agnes feels she has ""always spilled on herself when drinking, this is not new"". Nevertheless, she feels that her tremor and grip strength are proportionate to her anxiety, but wanted to emphasize ""my anxiety is not the cause.... it is much more controlled than it was in the past as my mother can no longer abuse me because she died"". Ms. also shared she is an active patient of Jessica Evanson, CCC. through Family Services at her church; she is seen every 2 weeks. Interestingly, Ms. also notes a direct correlation between her Crohn's symptoms and COVID symptoms, whereby the severity of these conditions are proportionate to one another; until three months ago, where her COVID symptoms became exacerbated, but her Crohn's did not. She is not aware of any new viral illness or subsequent COVID infections at that time and had tested herself but was negative. Today, her most bothersome symptoms are 1. chronic presyncopal symptoms, 2. palpitations, 3. brain fog, and 4. fatigue. Agnes shared that prior to her COVID infection, she struggled with postural lightheadedness, but her episodes were less frequent until three months ago, which now each time she changes positions, especially from a crouching position, as she stands she will begin to feel numbness in her legs and arms and have transient loss of vision/black spots. She will also have palpitations, which can occur in a seated position or with standing. She has had a loss of consciousness on a few occasions, but none in the past year. However, she does endorse frequent tripping/falling, which she feels is a combination of her knees buckling, as well as difficulty finding her footing. She also recently fell down the stairs, but avoided hitting her head, as she was able to grab the railing. Her husband also mentioned that Agnes struggles to get off the couch and he will need to assist her, as well as occasionally she will need assistant in the shower. Agnes tells me she now uses a shower chair, which has reduced her symptom burden. She denies any dyspnea with her palpitations. I have educated Agnes on the use of physical counterpressure maneuvers at the onset of her symptoms, which includes squatting, crossing one leg over the other and squeezing her leg muscles, abdomen, and gluteus, and holding this position as long as she can/ long pulsations until symptoms disappear. She may also try vigorous hand clenching and arm tensing (grip one hand with the other and pull them apart without letting go). Lastly, Ms. also complains of temperature dysregulation, stating she will go from feeling extremely cold to hot, but remains afebrile. She will also experience palpitations, noting that this happens every day when she sits down to take her lunch break at work, but does not occur with other meals, nor on a day when she is not working. She is currently getting 8-9 hours per night of uninterrupted sleep and is consuming anywhere from 3-3.75 L of water per day. Agnes also clarified that her symptoms post-COVID are discernable from her fibromyalgia, and she does not feel they are related. Overall, although there is no confirmatory test available at this time, Agnes' cluster of symptoms do seem consistent with Post-COVID Condition. Based on her history today, she notes a distinct exacerbation in symptoms approximately three months ago; I do wonder if she may have experienced a subsequent COVID infection, especially since her COVID antibody test today was positive, which is indicative of a COVID infection within the past 12 months. ASSESSMENT: In summary, Ms. is a 25-year-old COVID-19 survivor, who has struggled with a constellation of symptoms for the past 20 months, which are likely comparable with Post-COVID Condition and will continue to be treated as such. However, since there is currently no diagnostic test available to confirm a diagnosis, alternative underlying aetiologies should continue to be explored. PATIENT IDENTIFIED GOALS: v Fatigue v Brain Fog v Palpitations v Presyncope PLAN: 1. Fatigue/Brain Fog: I have sent a referral to Parkwood Post-Acute COVID-19 Rehabilitation to be assessed for OT/PT/SLP/SW supports. Ms. was also interested in participating in COVID-101, which is a 7-week virtual educational series focusing on lifestyle modifications for post-COVID/query PCC patients. Educational handouts on sleep hygiene were also provided. 2. Palpitations/Query Dysautonomia: I have sent a referral to Dr. Bhangu at Parkwood Hospital for tilt table testing to assess for dysautonomia/POTS. I have educated her on counter-pressure maneuvers for her symptoms of presyncope and encouraged her to take her time when changing positions. I have also ordered a CT head to rule/out any sinister causes, as well as an extended Holter monitor; Agnes was amenable to these. Her CT head has been scheduled for July 13th, 2024. I have encouraged Agnes to call the cancellation list if she would like to try and have this tested completed sooner. 3. Work Accommodations: I understand that Ms. has been working 30 hours/week since her COVID-19 infection. However, I discussed the option for work accommodations, as we have seen that any reduction in our patients work schedules have been beneficial in reducing their symptomatology. Often, our patients are most successful remaining off work/under accommodations until they have completed their COVID-101 educational sessions, and commenced their one-to-one rehabilitation sessions, where they can be further evaluated and considered safe to return to work. She shared with me she has previously applied for ODSP, but was declined. I explained to Ms. and her husband this was something that our team can assist with once she has been assessed by allied health. I encouraged her to reach out to our clinic if she had any questions. Dr. Henein, should Ms. be amenable to accommodations, I would recommend one of the following: 1. Medical Leave of Absence x 3 months then re-assess, 2. If she wishes to remain working, but would like accommodations, I have provided an example of some accommodation recommendations below, which you can evaluate on a monthly basis until he is seen by the Post-Acute COVID-19 Rehabilitation Program (approx. 4 months' time), who will modify his accommodations thereafter: Ø 4-6 hour shifts, 3 days/week, with a day off between working days Ø When possible, she should keep work hours consistent (i.e. all mornings or all afternoons) Ø Flexibility within her day to ensure adequate breaks (i.e. 5-minute break every 1- hour, 5-minute breaks between meetings/appointments, etc.) Ø Private/quiet work environment for cognitive tasks/documentation Ø Working from home privileges, when appropriate (if applicable) Ø Extensions on deadlines Ø No medical notes required for intermittent absences Ø Flexible work hours to accommodate medical appointments/rehabilitation Ø Agnes' workload expectations/demand under these aforementioned accommodations should not exceed the equivalent of part-time hours FOLLOW-UP: 4 months in-person ü Review Tilt Table Results (if completed) ü Review Extended Holter Monitor (if report available) ü Discuss progress of Post-Acute COVID-19 Rehabilitation Program Thank you, Dr. Henein, for referring Ms. . It is my pleasure being involved in her COVID-19 care. Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our clinic. Sincerely, Mariah Mariah Zalitach, MN NP-PHC Post-Acute COVID-19 Clinic St. Joseph's Health Care London"

Denstedt, MD, FRCSC Stephen Pautler, BSc, MD, F Peter G. Blake, MD, FRCPC DATE OF CONSULTATION: February 23, 2024 PATIENT LOCATION: J-PUL Dear Colleagues: Today, I saw in Respirology Long COVID Clinic assessment for his post-COVID cough. I am seeing him in consultation. He is accompanied by his wife. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: 1. Previous renal stones with septic stone concerns and recent hospitalization for septic presentation. 2. Actinic keratoses with radiation therapy and basal cell carcinoma history. 3. Congenital atrophic kidney. 4. ?asthma (secondary to potential exposure history in 2017). CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Trelegy Ellipta 1 puff daily (broken down into Breo Ellipta and Spiriva in hospital). 2. Nasonex nasal spray. 3. Vitamin D. 4. Recent course completion of doxycycline and Septra. 5. Singulair (recently discontinued). 6. Cetirizine. 7. Amiloride/hydrochlorothiazide. 8. Tylenol No. 3 p.r.n. 9. Flomax. 10. Omega 3. 11. Ventolin p.r.n. 12. Efudex 5% cream. 13. Tolterodine. ALLERGIES: Dust mites. Seasonal allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: Ken is retired currently. He is a previous employee of a copper and brass tubing manufacturing plant here in London at Wolverine. He is a very remote smoker, smoking in his teenage years at most, accumulating a 2 to 5-pack-year history of insignificance. FAMILY HISTORY: Strong family history of prostate cancer in his father and a colorectal cancer in his mother, I believe. His sister might have had sarcoidosis. RESPIRATORY HISTORY: Interestingly, Ken really describes a triggering event in 2017. This happened at the end of 2017 where he was potentially exposed to a large amount of dust and/or particulate from a pesticide for cleaning bedbugs in his sister's apartment. This triggered an assessment by my colleagues in Victoria Hospital in 2018, which was quite helpful to have as a baseline. He states that he might have had ""damage to his lungs at that point,"" like an asthma flare per se or reactive airways dysfunction syndrome that seemed to settle out or solidify. This would make sense as he seemed to have symptoms improved when he was reassessed in 2019 where he was much improved from a symptomatic perspective. It sounds like at that time in 2018, he was given an as needed Ventolin around just in case. He has some chronic symptoms of allergic rhinitis, which I think have been demonstrated on recent endoscopy by an ENT colleague. It sounds like there was some impressive inflammation based on endoscopy of his right naris and they were unable to enter the left side due to deviated septum. He is on chronic nasal rinse and steroids for this and this is somewhat helpful. I do not think this is contributing much to his cough as he really describes no problems overnight or when lying down per se. He does not describe any reflux, which is good as well. We talked about what things might have helped and ironically, he has not found that the Singulair or gabapentin had helped at all. He also tried some Zenhale and Ventolin and this was when he was first unwell, that seemed to help initially and then as he transitioned off, things have worsened. He has an Aerobika device, but I am not sure he has a lot of phlegm production per se. I would be interested to see what his CAT scan shows, but he felt like the Clavulin seemed to be the best thing for him. It is about 48 hours after his Clavulin was discontinued appropriately that things started to worsen. Right before the Clavulin was started, he states it was the thickest phlegm that he has had in sometime. Again, this would fit with bronchiectasis, something that was maybe slightly identifiable on his 2018 CT. Recently, because of his urosepsis from renal stones, he was placed on doxycycline and Septra for the tail end of his hospitalization. He states that did not really helped him per se as much as the Clavulin, but might have helped some of his phlegm reduced. He still has an ongoing cough even here today in clinic that is not super productive. The last discussion point he had today with me was about corticosteroid therapy. At this point, I do not have any reason to give him oral corticosteroids based on his breathing tests and a CT scan, but interestingly enough, he had an x-ray back in January when he was admitted in the hospital and it was concerning enough to have some abnormalities on the lateral aspect. There is a band-like density that is likely in keeping with atelectasis, but it is odd for him to have this at this point. There are also some displaced rib fractures in the sixth, seventh and eighth ribs that were noted and again, this is in keeping with him having previous rib fractures, even prior _____ old. Overall, we had a good chat today that unfortunately can really does not have a slam dunk diagnosis of what is happening outside of him having some history of reactive airways or irritant induced asthma and I think this is likely still contributing. Interestingly, with his CT scan having some abnormalities on his left side more than his right, especially with a dilated set of airways, I do wonder about some mild bronchiectasis. Again, with some family history of sarcoid and what not, I do wonder about abnormalities of something autoimmune. I think it would be important for him to have an assessment for full workup of autoimmune disease in addition for etiologies of bronchiectasis, because I think he has got something underlying, but I cannot put my finger on it yet. He was thankful for this discussion as I think he is a bit concerned that this cough is quite consistent and persistent, but interestingly did go away with Clavulin. I suggested that something like azithromycin could be utilized in his management plan going forward, especially if he has something more like a neutrophilic component of bronchitis. He was interested in this and I think we need a CT scan first and then consider a bronchoscopy. A methacholine is also warranted based on his clinical symptoms and overall normal spirometry. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Ken looked well, in no distress. He was saturating 98% on room air. Respiratory exam revealed some very mild early inspiratory crackles in his left mid lung zone without any adventitious wheeze heard anywhere else. INVESTIGATIONS: I was able to squeeze him in for full pulmonary function testing today that are pretty impressively normal outside of an isolated elevated residual volume. His FEV1 was 113% predicted or 3.71 litres. This is improved from his previous spirometry he had through Best Care in November of 2023. FVC is also increased to 117% or 4.97 litres. TLC was normal at 114; however, his RV was elevated at 136. DLCO was normal at 104. As mentioned, a chest x-ray performed on January 25 shows some band-like opacification in his right lower lobe with some atelectasis. There are also those rib fractures. CT scan performed in 2018 does reveal some mild asymmetrical bronchiectasis changes. It is very minimal on that left side along with some band-like atelectasis. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ken is a pleasant 66-year-old gentleman who has some very impressive chronic cough post-viral infection. This is a known entity, but based on his RADS history from 2017, followed by my colleague previously, I do think there is something underlying that is concerning. He was amenable for us to have some further workup and I really appreciate Dr. Bevan arranging for a CAT scan already. I think he would benefit from a bronchoscopy to rule out some atypical microorganisms as well as atypical cells like neutrophils that could be there if he is still having decent set of symptoms. I will arrange for a methacholine in addition to him staying on his Trelegy that he has not started yet, but has not picked up going forward. He was amenable to this. We will follow him up after he has had the methacholine, the CT scan and the blood work completed. If there is something grossly abnormal on the blood work, I will call him beforehand.

He is sent in for COVID as he had a possible exposure in 2020 and again in 2023. He states he had a rapid antigen test that was positive, as I do not have any PCR positivity. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: 1. ? sleep apnea. 2. Hypercholesterol. 3. Vitiligo. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: As-needed Buscopan. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: Mr. is a real estate agent. He has an occasional social smoker. FAMILY HISTORY: Strong family history of psoriasis. No other obvious autoimmune diseases. COVID HISTORY: Mr. describes having an infection at the end of 2019 where he was quite unwell. He believes it is around October or November. Unfortunately, I am not sure that was related to the COVID infection itself, however, he was questioning it. He states he then got another course of the COVID infection in 2020 where he was quite unwell. Unfortunately, I could not locate his PCR testing to corroborate the story both on OLIS or on our London health Sciences Centre panel. He describes symptoms that were mild in nature, so to speak. He then unfortunately had COVID in the end of 2023 where he was rapid antigen test positive, he states, where it was quite a sinus irritation. He has some low-grade fevers and some anorexia. Other than that, he seemed to get over it pretty quick. He states he had a bit of what he calls black eyes ""when he had his infection that seemed to go to his sinus passage."" Since then, he has slowly had a worsening set of ongoing fatigue and shortness of breath. He also has brain fog, word-finding difficulties and reduced concentration. This has been difficult for him to operate and work as much as he should be. His other big concern is that he had a tick bite at some point in the last 12 months where he came up to the Emergency Room and was initiated on a course of doxycycline, he believes. He had a classic bull's eye rash, he describes. I suggested that I would do some serology today and some blood work. He was thankful for this. He has also noticed some paresthesias in his left lower leg that really sound like peroneal changes. I think this could be investigated further if his Lyme disease serology was negative. From a joint perspective, this is relatively new and worsening where he is quite symptomatic in his elbows and knees. He was quite active with lots of snowboarding and outdoor exercises what has definitely taken a backseat recently. With his psoriatic arthritis family history and him having some concerning rash lesions, he is worried that this could be playing a role. I do agree. I think that we should investigate this further with other inflammatory joint workup biochemistry analysis today as well as sending him to a colleague in Rheumatology. He was amenable to this. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Mr. looked well and in no distress. He was saturating 96 on room air. Blood pressure and heart rate were normal. Mr. showed me some slow and low-growing rash-like lesions on his forearm. They were more like purpura than anything else. There were no raised lesions or petechial changes. Head and neck exam was unremarkable. INVESTIGATIONS: Full pulmonary function tests today are completely normal. ECG today in clinic is normal. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Jeff is a 49-year-old gentleman with likely long COVID symptoms based on his history of COVID infection at least more recently. I cannot explain his 2020 or his 2019 infection per se, as I do not have the ability for a PCR test in 2019 and in 2020, I cannot find anything on our system. Nevertheless, I think he would likely benefit from our Long COVID Pulmonary Rehab Program, especially with his history and with his concussion history, he believes. From a joint discomfort perspective, I have done some autoimmune workup and he was amenable to this. This is in addition to his paraesthesias. I will still have our colleague, Dr. Arnold, assess from a rheumatological perspective. From a bull's eye lesion post tick bite and doxycycline management plan perspective, I have done a Lyme serology to see what it's worth for that result. I have not made arrangements to see him back in our clinic here in the Long COVID at St. Joe's, but he will follow up with the Parkwood team. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

She denied any dizziness or lightheadedness · Respiratory: was speaking in full sentences. She had no increased work of breathing, and her lungs were clear with good air entry bilaterally. No cough present during her exam · Cardiovascular: s1/s2 normal with no additional heart sounds appreciated. Pulse strong and regular. No peripheral edema noted. ACTIVE ISSUES DISCUSSED TODAY: Today I met with Ms.to discuss her COVID timeline. She tells me she first became symptomatic of COVID on July 13th, 2022 and tested positive via PCR on July 18th, 2022. Her initial symptoms were ""tickling of the lungs"", cough, feeling faint, shortness of breath - especially when walking the dog, ""flu-like"" symptoms, body aches, and fever. She did not require hospitalization or supplemental oxygen; however, she was prescribed Symbicort and Spiriva with good effect. Her acute symptoms lasted for approximately two weeks. Thereafter, she saw improvement, but felt lingering brain fog and fatigue. She also began to experience significant pain in her head/ears/sinuses/behind her eyes (unable to lie on either ear), in addition to ""eye puffiness"" and swollen lymph nodes of her neck. She states she trialed 6 weeks of a nasal spray but was ineffective. Most recently, was started on daily Blexten with some effect. She has been taking this medication daily since. Additionally, she has been struggling with new onset neck and joint pain, intermittent rash, and hair loss. She was trialed on prednisone, which she found effective, but was only on this medication short-term. In April 2023, she tells me she had an IUS inserted and since such time developed abnormal bleeding, abdominal pain, and stomach issues. Her symptoms became so bothersome, she had her IUS removed in October, 2023, with moderate improvement in her symptoms. However, she then developed lightheadedness with standing which is associated with mild nausea that is slowly improving; she denies any slips/trips/falls or loss of consciousness. When asked about any provoking or alleviating factors, she states ""the sun is helpful"" as well as she tried acupuncture with good effect; but cost is a limiting factor. I also discuss with the results of her modified stand test today, which may be suggestive of dysautonomia, query postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Since this was only a modified test, I recommended a referral to Dr. Bhangu at Parkwood, who can perform a tilt table test, as well as assess her for dysautonomia and treat/refer her as necessary. Her ECG today was normal, as was her previous extended Holter monitor. However, I will also order an echo to have completed prior to her consultation with Dr. Bhangu for review. Regarding her arthralgia, she is on Celebrex, naproxen, and Lyrica, with moderate effect. I have also recommended a trial of B 100 complex which has shown some effect for nerve pain, and may be helpful during her HSV outbreaks, for which she is currently on Lyrica PRN. Hair Loss: Likely telogen effluvium. I discussed to option of adding zinc and biotin supplementation for this, which has been the previous recommendation from dermatology. Since she is also concerned about an intermittent rash, she has requested a consultation to dermatology. As such, I will send a referral to Dr. Loo; is aware the wait list can be lengthy. Mood: states she has found her mood to be low due to her energy levels. She states she has not lost lack of interest in activities, rather, lack of motivation due minimal energy levels. She feels since her COVID infection, her mood as improved slightly. She has no concerns regarding her sleep and denies any snoring/gasping for air throughout the night. Since her PHQ-4 score today was 7/10 (moderate psychological distress/positive screen for depression), I asked if she would like to speak with someone, for which she responded with ""I am happy to accept anything you can offer"". I discussed with her the Ontario Structured Psychotherapy Program West Region (OSP West), and the process for which she will have a telephone intake interview where they will determine the amount of support she may require, such as biweekly telephone appointments with self-directed learning between sessions, group cognitive behavioural therapy sessions, or she may be offered one-to-one CBT sessions. Her level of support may also change throughout her time in the program. was amenable to this, and she is aware it can be 6-8 weeks before initial contact is made. ASSESSMENT: In summary, Ms.is a 27-year-old COVID-19 survivor, who struggles with a constellation of symptoms, such as brain fog, fatigue, and dysautonomia, which are likely secondary to Post-COVID Condition. However, there is currently no diagnostic test available at this time to confirm a diagnosis. PATIENT IDENTIFIED GOALS: v Brain Fog v Fatigue v Sinus Pressure v Telogen Effluvium v Mood PLAN: 1. Fatigue/Brain Fog: I have sent a referral to Parkwood Post-Acute COVID-19 Rehabilitation to be assessed for OT/PT/SLP/SW supports. Ms.was also interested in participating in COVID-101, which is a 7-week virtual educational series focusing on lifestyle modifications. Educational handouts on sleep hygiene were also provided. 2. Positive Modified Stand Test: a modified stand test was completed today on Ms. Lumb, which did show a sustained standing heart rate >30 bpm from supine, without a drop in blood pressure. This was associated with symptoms of ""tunnel vision"". She also states she often feels lightheaded when standing throughout the day. She is likely suffering from dysautonomia, query POTS, as such, I have sent a referral to Dr. Bhangu for tilt table testing and a further dysautonomia assessment. When she is feeling symptomatic, she should engage in counter-pressure maneuvers and take her time when changing positions as well as I would recommend an increased salt intake (2 g sodium daily) and increased water intake (2.5-3 L daily). Should these be ineffective, Dr. Carter, you may consider a trial a of a low dose beta blocker, such a 2.5 mg bisoprolol daily, if there are no formal contraindications to this medication. I have also ordered an echocardiogram; was amenable to these. 3. Sinus Pressure: states she has trialed 6 weeks of nasal spray without effect. She is also on high-dose Blexten with minimal effect. As such, I have recommended a CT sinus and referral to ENT which she was agreeable to. I have faxed a referral to Dr. Sowerby and CT has been order. 4. Telogen Effluvium: There is no treatment for Telogen Effluvium, but, most patient's hair will eventually stop shedding and grow back to look normal again typically within six to nine months. However, since this has been ongoing beyond nine months, and at 's request, I have sent a referral to Dr. Loo in dermatology. I have also recommended adding zinc and biotin supplementation which has shown some effect. Should this be ineffective, she may also consider a trial of 5% Rogaine foam topical, daily, though we did discuss this treatment is associated with increased cost. 5. Mood/Apathy: I discussed with the Ontario Structured Psychotherapy Program (OSP West), which is a program that offers OHIP funded CBT support, as well as self-directed learning modules; Ms.was amenable to a referral, therefore, I have faxed a referral to OSP West with her consent. She was also provided with our mental health pamphlet containing various mental health resources within the community and region, along with Reach Out and the new 988 crisis support numbers. 6. Work Accommodations: I understand that Ms.has been working full-time since her COVID-19 infection. However, I discussed with her the option for work accommodations, as we have seen that any reduction in our patients work schedules have been beneficial in reducing their symptomatology. Often, our patients are most successful remaining off work/under accommodations until they have completed their COVID-101 educational sessions, and commenced their one-to-one rehabilitation sessions, where they can be further evaluated and considered safe to return to work. I explained to Ms.this was not a decision she needed to make today, however, she is aware it is an option for her. Dr. Carter, should Ms.be amenable to accommodations, I would recommend one of the following: 1. Medical Leave of Absence x 2-3 weeks then re-assess, 2.

JOSEPH'S HEALTH CARE LONDON INITIAL CONSULTATION DATE: March 4th, 2024 LOCATION: Post-Acute COVID-19 Clinic 08:00 hr - 08:15 hr: Ms. Rody consented to participate in the Long COVID-Optimize study conducted through Lawson Research, whereby she completed surveys via a tablet provided to her by a member of the research team. Two additional sodium citrate tubes were also drawn by nursing staff, with Ms. Rody's consent. (R-23-553) PATIENT IDENTIFICATION: Ms. Fay Rody is a pleasant 56-year-old female who was referred to the Post-Acute COVID-19 Clinic by Dr. Sylvia Murchison for the assessment and treatment of Post-COVID Condition (PCC). She is a patient of Dr. Faria Rubab. Fay was accompanied today by her mother, Jocelyne. SOCIAL HISTORY: Ms. Rody lives in London, Ontario. Her 25-year-old son lives with her, but is away for extended periods of time. She also has a son who is 28 years old.

She was dressed appropriately and engaged in conversation. HEIGHT: 162 cm WEIGHT: 70 kg BMI: 26.7 kg/m2 VITAL SIGNS: March 4th/24 at 08:04 hr Temperature 36.2oC Heart Rate 62 bmp Respiratory Rate 16 Systolic Blood Pressure 118 mmHg Diastolic Blood Pressure 77 mmHg Site Right Arm Oxygen Saturation 98 % FOCUSED PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT: Neuro: Ms. Rody was alert and oriented x3 throughout her assessment. She complained of mild lightheadedness with deep breathing Respiratory: Ms. Rody was speaking in full sentences. She had no increased work of breathing, and her lungs were clear with good air entry bilaterally. No cough present Cardiovascular: soft holosystolic murmur appreciated. Pulse strong and regular. Radial pulse 63 bpm. Integumentary: Raynaud's flare present ACTIVE ISSUES DISCUSSED TODAY: Today I met with Ms. Rody and her mother to discuss her COVID timeline. She tells me she first contracted COVID on September 12th, 2023 and tested positive via a home rapid antigen test. Her initial symptoms were ""flu-like"" consisting of fever, weakness, and fatigue - to the point where she said she was unable to speak. She also began to experience tingling throughout her body, from ""the top of her head to the tips of her toes"" and at times she was unable to stand. She further distinguished it is ""not pins and needles"". Her acute symptoms lasted for approximately a week. She also describes a loss of smell and myalgia. Today, she suffers mostly with her fatigue and diffuse tingling. Ms. Rody spoke about specific occurrences when her symptoms were the most severe, stating she has had three. She first began by acknowledging she can be an anxious person, and proceeded to describe her first severe attack, which was at the airport. She states she was tolerating the environment, until the airline changed her gate shortly before boarding which set off her symptoms whereby she became very weak and no longer able speak or to walk, requiring a wheelchair. Once boarding the plane, she took an alprazolam and felt much better thereafter. She then described her third occurrence, which was past weekend while attending her pedicure appointment. She states that she felt well going into the appointment, but after, the tingling was so severe she was unable to stand and she required assistance from two employees to get her down the stairs and to her friend's car. Once home, she noted her ""hands convulsing"" and she was ""unable to grab on to things"". In terms of provoking factors, she feels these episodes are consistent with her level of fatigue, and stimulation, in addition to being induced by excitability, further explaining she became ""excited"" when she received the call from our Clinic regarding her appointment, which triggered her symptoms to flare. Furthermore, she states she will wake in the middle of the night after an exciting dream, and will begin the experience tingles throughout her body. Regarding driving, she states she has an accessibility sticker which has been very helpful, however, when she feels unable to drive, she will have her mother pick her up. She struggles immensely with medical appointments, sharing she recently attempted to attend a medical appointment independently, but became quickly overwhelmed and had to pull over on the side of the road and call her mother to pick her up and take her to her appointment and back home again. Interestingly, Faye continues to work full time as a chief Financial advisor. She feels that working is one of the few things that does not exacerbate her symptoms, elaborating it is due to being on ""autopilot"". She shared she feels she functions well within the workplace and uses her weekends to rest. However, she temporarily moved in with her partner, Tony, to assist him after his knee replacement and this has increased her symptoms. I discussed with Fay and her mother about post exertional malaise syndrome (PEM) and how both cognitive and/or physical insertion can worsen this condition. As such, many of our patients who suffer from PEM consider taking time off work, or going on modified/ accommodated duties for a period of time to help reduce crashes in their energy. I further explained that this was not a decision she should make today, rather, something for her to keep in the back of her mind as an option as she continues through this journey. Regarding her sleep, she denies any snoring but states she sleeps with her mouth open leading to waking with a dry mouth. She considers her sleep to be unrefreshing and endorses daytime sleepiness. She states her sleep has always been poor, even before her COVID infection. Nevertheless, I suggested a referral to a sleep specialist and possible sleep study, which she was amenable to this. approximately 30 minutes into our appointment today, Fay stopped and told me she was experiencing an active episode of tingling. She sat in her chair with her hands on her thighs. Her face remained symmetrical and speech clear, though she was closing her eyes frequently and focused on deep breathing. I applied an oximeter which showed a HR of 65 and oxygen remained 100% throughout her episode. I also noted the distal portion of her fingers to be quite red, indicating a likely Raynaud's flare. Regarding a plan of care moving forward, I suggested due to her previous history of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, diagnosis of Crohn's Disease in grade 12 (although currently in remission), as well as history of Raynaud's, I suggested a referral to Dr. Arnold who is a rheumatologist at the Arva clinic. RF negative, ANA pending (negative 2015). Furthermore, I will send a referral to Dr. Takahashi from neurology, to rule out a neurological cause. However, I did share with Ms. Rody it is somewhat common for patients seen in our clinic to describe this type of symptom. I also suggested she can trial B100 complex which has some emerging evidence it may help with nerve pain. Additionally, she was started on duloxetine by Dr. Rubab, and was recently suggested to increase her dose from 30 mg to 60 mg. However, Fay deferred this increase until she could discuss further with our clinic, which I have no concerns with increasing her dose. I also emphasized she should reach out to Dr. Rubab before increasing her dose, as this is something that should be done in consultation with the prescriber. She is also aware she should not reduce her dose without speaker to the prescriber or her pharmacist first. She understood this information and was agreeable. Lastly, regarding her fatigue, I discussed a referral to the Parkwood rehabilitation program, which includes a 7-week virtual group education series (COVID-101) and she can begin group sessions as early as this Thursday afternoon. However, one-to-one services are currently an approximate 4-5 month wait. She was accepting of this referral. I further shared with Fay and her mother that I cannot be certain her (or many of our patient's) symptoms are due to Post-COVID Condition (PCC), as there is no diagnostic test. However, current treatment for PCC is currently supportive care and rehabilitation. As such, we will proceed down this pathway while continuing to rule out other possible potential causes. ASSESSMENT: In summary, Ms. Rody is a 56-year-old COVID-19 survivor, who struggles with a constellation of symptoms which may be secondary to Post-COVID Condition. However, since there is currently no diagnostic test available, a diagnosis can only be made by exclusion, therefore alternative underlying aetiologies should continue to be explored. PATIENT IDENTIFIED GOALS: Diffuse tingling Weakness Fatigue Post-Exertional Malaise Brain Fog PLAN: Fatigue/Post-Exertional Malaise/Brain Fog: I have sent a referral to Parkwood Post-Acute COVID-19 Rehabilitation to be assessed for OT/PT/SLP/SW supports. Ms. Rody was also interested in participating in COVID-101, which is a 7-week virtual educational series focusing on lifestyle modifications for post-COVID/query PCC patients. Educational handouts were also provided. Additionally, since Ms. Rody wakes frequently throughout the night, finds her sleep unrefreshing, and has daytime sleepiness, I have faxed a referral for a sleep specialist consultation at Peak Sleep. Diffuse Tingling/Weakness: I have recommended a trial of B100 complex which has shown some evidence to help with nerve pain. Additionally, I have faxed a referral to Dr. Arnold at the Arva clinic to rule out an autoimmune cause. As well as a referral to Dr. Takahashi from neurology to further investigate. She is aware these referrals can be several months wait for a consultation. Fay is also considering increasing in her Duloxetine from 30 mg to 60 mg, but will speak with Dr. Rubab before doing so. If 60 mg is not effective, our psychiatrist has previously recommended a trial of tapering off Duloxetine and switching to Venlafaxine starting at a low dose - since Venlafaxine works on two different neurotransmitters at higher doses, Ms. Rody may find more benefit increasing to a dose >75 mg daily. Work Accommodations: I understand that Ms. Rody has been working full-time since her COVID-19 infection. However, I discussed with her the option for work accommodations, as we have seen that any reduction in our patients work schedules have been beneficial in reducing their symptomatology. Often, our patients are most successful remaining off work/under accommodations until they have completed their COVID-101 educational sessions, and commenced their one-to-one rehabilitation sessions, where they can be further evaluated and considered safe to return to work. I explained to Ms. Rody this was not a decision she needed to make today, however, I asked her to take some time to think about it more. I encouraged her to reach out to our clinic if she had any questions. Dr. Rubab, should Ms. Rody be amenable to accommodations, I would recommend one of the following: 1. Medical Leave of Absence x 2-3 weeks then re-assess, 2. If she wishes to remain working, but would like accommodations, I have provided some sample accommodation recommendations below, which you can evaluate on a monthly basis until she is seen by the Post-Acute COVID-19 Rehabilitation Program (approx. 4-5 months' time), who will modify her accommodations thereafter: 4-6 hour shifts, 3 days/week, with a day off between working days When possible, she should keep work hours consistent (i.e. all mornings or all afternoons) Flexibility within her day to ensure adequate breaks (i.e. 5-minute break every 1- hour, 5-minute breaks between meetings/appointments, etc.) Private/quiet work environment Working from home privileges, when appropriate Extensions on deadlines No medical notes required for intermittent absences Flexible work hours to accommodate medical appointments/rehabilitation Ms. Rody's workload expectations/demand under these aforementioned accommodations should not exceed the equivalent of part-time hours FOLLOW-UP: 3-4 months in person Thank you, Dr. Murchison, for referring Ms. Rody. It is my pleasure being involved in her COVID-19 care. Should yourself or Dr. Rubab have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our clinic.

No cough present during her exam Cardiovascular: s1/s2 normal with no additional heart sounds appreciated. Pulse strong and regular. ACTIVE ISSUES DISCUSSED TODAY: I met with Emily today to discuss her COVID journey. She tells me her symptoms first began on October 31st, 2023 with a sore throat, fatigue, and one day of fever. On November 1st, 2023, she tested positive for COVID on a home rapid antigen test. She states her symptoms lasted approximately 10 days. On November 2nd until November 10th, she experienced fatigue, brain fog, and dyspnea and on November 11th, she began to have very sharp pain in her chest with tachycardia, prompting her to the Emergency Department (ED) on November 12th, 2023. She returned again to the ED on November 15th, 2023 where she tells me a bedside ultrasound was performed and she was subsequently diagnosed with post COVID pericarditis and prescribed 6 weeks of high-dose NSAIDs. Her symptoms worsened once again on December 15th, 2023 and she returned to the ED due to dyspnea numbness in her arms and face. She was given a provisional diagnosis of asthma and prescribed Symbicort with moderate effect. Today, Ms. Taylor endorses in her acute symptoms, however, she continues to struggle with shortness of breath, fatigue, insomnia, night sweats, palpitations, and tachycardia. I reviewed with Emily her pulmonary function tests which were completely normal. Therefore, I have asked she reduced Symbicort from 2 puffs BID to one puff BID for the next month. Should her symptoms remain at bay, she can begin to reduce to an as needed basis with a maximum of 8 puffs in 24 hours. However, Ms. Taylor is aware if she notes an increase in symptoms, she should return to scheduled dosing and follow up with her primary care provider. Regarding her night sweats, she denies any fevers, but does endorse unintentional weight loss of approximately 25 lbs, which she attributes to her previously reduced appetite. However, although she says her appetite has mostly returned, she is concerned she is unable to put weight back on. Her bloodwork today shows no obvious causes; however, I will leave further evaluation in the capable hands of Dr. McKay. Additionally, Emily mentioned she has been having menstruation abnormalities and requested a referral back to Dr. Swan at Medpoint for IUS removal, which I was agreeable to. A detailed symptom log was provided during our visit today and a copy can be found in the patient's paper chart). Additionally, we discussed dysautonomia and/or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), however, her stand test today was equivocal, therefore, I recommended a referral. To Dr. Bhangu, who is an extension of our team and can further assess and complete a tilt table test if indicated. Emily was amenable to a referral. She also shared she has an appointment at London Cardiac Institute (LCI) in August, 2024 as well as a Holter monitor and echocardiogram on April 4th, 2024. Since a Holter was recently completed by myself, which I reviewed with Emily today, I asked her permission to send a copy to LCI so it did not have to repeated, which she consented to. I have also requested once completed, a copy of her echocardiogram be sent to myself and Dr. Bhangu for review. Ms. Taylor also asked about subsequent COVID immunizations, which I politely asked she defer this question to the cardiology team, given her history of post COVID pericarditis. However, if safe to do so, our team continues to encourage getting vaccinated as per the recommendations of Health Canada and the Middlesex London Health Unit. However, I did share there have been a handful of our patients who have reported a temporary setback in their symptoms for approximately 2 weeks' time after immunization; conversely, a select number of our patients report mild improvement in their symptoms post-vaccine. But, we have had multiple patients report significant and prolonged setbacks in their symptoms secondary to a subsequent COVID-19 infection. As such, Emily is encouraged to continue practicing safe social distancing and being mindful of large public gatherings, especially when indoors. She understood this information provided to her. Regarding her fatigue, I discussed a referral to the Parkwood rehabilitation program, which includes a 7-week virtual group education series (COVID-101) and she can begin group sessions as early as this Thursday afternoon. However, one-to-one services are an approximate 4-5 month wait at this time. She was accepting of this referral, but could not begin this week. I have reassured her that is ok and she can discuss scheduling further with the rehabilitation team, who will reach out to her either this week or early next. I also discussed with Ms. Taylor about having likely post exertional malaise syndrome (PEM) and how both cognitive and/or physical insertion can worsen this condition. As such, many of our patients who suffer from PEM consider taking time off work, or going on modified/ accommodated duties for a period of time to help reduce crashes in their energy. I emphasized this was not a decision I was asking her to make today, rather, something for her to keep in the back of her mind as an option as she continues through this journey. Finally, I reviewed. Emily's PHQ 4 survey from today, which she scored 'mild psychological distress'. I offered a referral to the Ontario Structured Psychotherapy Program West Region (OSP West), however, she politely declined, sharing she sees a Registered Psychotherapist (qualifying) in Hamilton once a week, named Lyndsey. I shared with Emily that I cannot be certain her (or many of our patient's) symptoms are due to Post-COVID Condition (PCC), as there is no diagnostic test. However, treatment for PCC is currently supportive care and rehabilitation. As such, we will venture down this pathway while continuing to rule out other possible potential causes of her symptoms. ASSESSMENT: In summary, Ms. Taylor is a 29-year-old COVID-19 survivor, who struggles with a constellation of symptoms which may be secondary to Post-COVID Condition. However, since there is currently no diagnostic test available, a diagnosis can only be made by exclusion, therefore alternative underlying aetiologies should continue to be explored. PATIENT IDENTIFIED GOALS: Dyspnea Fatigue Insomnia Palpitations Oligomenorrhea PLAN: Fatigue/Dyspnea: I have sent a referral to Parkwood Post-Acute COVID-19 Rehabilitation to be assessed for OT/PT/SLP/SW supports. Ms. Taylor was also interested in participating in COVID-101, which is a 7-week virtual educational series focusing on lifestyle modifications for post-COVID/query PCC patients. Educational handouts were also provided. Her PFT's are completely normal, therefore I have asked her to reduced her Symbicort from 2 puffs BID to 1 puff BID for the next month, and to slowly wean off this medication to PRN only. Palpitations: possible dysautonomia/Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS). I have faxed a referral to Dr. Bhangu for consultation and possible tilt table test. Emily's supine to standing heart rate today increased by 18 bpm, which is less than a diagnosis for POTS (> 30 bpm). However, her supine HR is quite high (100 bpm) and she has had times when her HR has been in the 130's upon wakening, therefore I will lean on the expertise of Dr. Bhangu. When she is feeling symptomatic, she should engage in counter-pressure maneuvers and take her time when changing positions. Since first line treatment is usually conservative measures, I have as recommended she can trial increasing her salt intake (2 g sodium daily) and water intake (2.5-3 L daily) to determine effectiveness on symptoms. Should these be ineffective, first line pharmacotherapy is to trial a low dose beta blocker, such a 2.5 mg bisoprolol daily. However, Ms. Taylor does have an appointment with cardiology in August, 2024 at London Cardiac Institute. She also has an echocardiogram scheduled at LCI on April 4th, 2024; recent Holter monitor shows only 16% tachycardia beats. Oligomenorrhea: Emily has requested to have her Kyleena IUS removed due to menstrual abnormalities. I contacted Medpoint, but unfortunately, Dr. Swan no longer works at their clinic. As such, Dr. McKay, I will leave this request in your capable hands. COVID-19 Vaccines: I have asked Emily to speak with her cardiologist further regarding future COVID-19 vaccines, due to her history of COVID-induced pericarditis. She was amenable to this. Should there be no concerns from a cardiac perspective, Emily is aware that our clinic does recommend patients continue to receive their updated COVID vaccines as recommendation by Health Canada and the Middlesex London Health Unit. She has been encouraged to continue practice safe social distancing and being mindful of large public gatherings, especially when indoors. Vitamin D Insufficiency: Vitamin D today was 70 nmol/L. She is borderline target of 75 nmol/L, therefore, I have asked Emily to increase her cholecalciferol from 1,000 iu daily to 2,000 iu daily, with food. Work Accommodations: I understand that Ms. Taylor has continued working full-time since her COVID-19 infection. However, I discussed with her the option for work accommodations, as we have seen that any reduction in our patients work schedules have been beneficial in reducing their symptomatology. Often, our patients are most successful remaining off work/under accommodations until they have completed their COVID-101 educational sessions, and commenced their one-to-one rehabilitation sessions, where they can be further evaluated and considered safe to return to work. I explained to Ms. Taylor this was not a decision she needed to make today, however, I asked her to take some time to think about it more. I encouraged her to reach out to our clinic if she had any questions. Dr. McKay, should Ms. Taylor be amenable to accommodations, I would recommend one of the following: 1. Medical Leave of Absence x 2-3 weeks then re-assess, 2. If she wishes to remain working, but would like accommodations, I have provided some sample accommodation recommendations below, which you can evaluate on a monthly basis until she is seen by the Post-Acute COVID-19 Rehabilitation Program (approx. 4-5 months' time), who will modify her accommodations thereafter: 4-6 hour shifts, 3 days/week, with a day off between working days When possible, she should keep work hours consistent (i.e. all mornings or all afternoons) Flexibility within her day to ensure adequate breaks (i.e. 5-minute break every 1- hour, 5-minute breaks between meetings/appointments, etc.) Private/quiet work environment Working from home privileges, when appropriate Extensions on deadlines No medical notes required for intermittent absences Flexible work hours to accommodate medical appointments/rehabilitation Ms. Taylor's workload expectations/demand under these aforementioned accommodations should not exceed the equivalent of part-time hours FOLLOW-UP: 3-4 months in person Thank you, Dr. McKay, for referring Ms. Taylor. It is my pleasure being involved in her COVID-19 care. Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our clinic.

"RESPIROLOGY CONSULTATION (Unverified) J435067 cc: Aditya Devgan DATE OF CONSULTATION: March 8, 2024 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Dr. Devgan, Today, I saw Ruth Hall in Respirology Clinic for assessment of her chronic cough. This is a cough that she had prior to COVID, but was exacerbated by her COVID infection. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: 1. Chronic cough with possible asthmatic component. 2. Complex papillary breast lesion. 3. Upper airway cough syndrome/postnasal drip, concerning for chronic rhinosinusitis. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Previous PPI therapy for cough. 2. Nasal saline rinse with nasal steroid therapy. 3. Ventolin p.r.n. 4. Symbicort p.r.n. ALLERGIES: ? metals. SOCIAL HISTORY: Ruth is currently retired. She is a remote ex-smoker, quitting many years ago now. She smoked at most for 20-pack-year history. She is independent of her ADLs and IADLs. COUGH HISTORY: Unfortunately, Ruth describes a dry cough that persisted prior to COVID. Interestingly, her father had something similar. It was made worse by COVID and she explained that this has been a troubling feature for her. Unfortunately, it sounds like it is worse with cough and phlegm that is more liquid and _____, but is not necessarily abnormal in appearance as she has never looked at it. It is happening both day and night and is associated with postnasal drip symptoms. I suggested that she might need to consider reintroducing nasal therapies as well as the inhaler therapies. The reason I state this is that she feels like she is now using Ventolin and it has helped and reduced some coughing fits that she is having. She also notes that she might have had some importance with Symbicort as well. I suggested that even though she had pulmonary testing done that was pretty normal, you can have some mild asthma and normal pulmonary function test. She had a pre and post done that only changed about 4% post, but again with normal testing does not rule out mild asthma and a methacholine would be quite helpful. She was amenable to undergoing something like that going forward. She states that her postnasal drip was very intermittent at first and might have had some responsiveness to steroids. I again wonder if there is some mild inflammatory component that is overlapping both this as well as her cough and phlegm. She has no family history of asthma and has never had a personal history of asthma as well. She caught COVID in June of 2022 and found that her smell and taste would definitely impact as well as fatigue. She interestingly did not have a lot of chest symptoms that were worse with that. This was after being updated with her vaccine status at that point, which is reassuring. She denies any other long COVID symptoms like brain fog, fatigue, or memory issues. Her big concern right now is with the cough worsening more recently and her having issues with being in coughing fits that she is sick to her stomach. Unfortunately, this was difficult to hear, but the fact that it has responded to some therapies such as Ventolin, I think it is important for her to potentially continue down this pathway. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Ruth looked well, in no distress. She is saturating 97 on room air. Blood pressure and heart rate were normal. Respiratory exam was negative for any clubbing and had normal breath sounds heard without any adventitious sounds appreciated. INVESTIGATIONS: As mentioned earlier, Strathroy pulmonary function test performed in August 2023 showed normal ratio and an FEV1 of 128%. There is no post-bronchodilator change. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ruth Hall is a pleasant 69-year-old lady, who I think would benefit from a methacholine challenge to see if she has irritable airways that would give her a diagnosis of mild asthma. This would make sense clinically as she does have a response to Ventolin and maybe Symbicort. I have asked her to undergo the methacholine and to do some phenotyping blood work today. She was amenable to this. We will see her back after the methacholine is arranged to get some confirmed answers. Otherwise, it might be something to focus more on in her upper airways like her postnasal drip symptomatology. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

"RESPIROLOGY CONSULTATION (Unverified) J575986 cc: Thomas W. Tam, MD DATE OF CONSULTATION: March 8, 2024 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Dr. Tam: Today, I saw Jo Hollohan along with his wife in Respirology Long COVID Clinic for assessment of his long COVID symptomatology. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: 1. Hypertension. 2. Dyslipidemia. 3. Ex-smoking history. 4. Does have alcohol consumption. 5. Previous CHF. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Ventolin p.r.n. 2. Nitro spray p.r.n. 3. Rosuvastatin. 4. Bisoprolol. 5. Aspirin 81 daily. 6. Ramipril. 7. Allopurinol. 8. Folic acid. ALLERGIES: No known drug or environmental allergies. FAMILY HISTORY: No strong family history of pulmonary disease. SOCIAL HISTORY: Mr. Hollohan is retired. He is an ex-smoker, quitting about 20 plus years ago. He has accumulated maybe a 25 to 30-pack-year smoking history, all told. He is retired and does not have any obvious exposure history. COVID HISTORY: Jo describes being pretty sick when he was down East in Newfoundland visiting family. It sounds like he arrived and was almost immediately sick. His wife also had COVID and they both tested positive on a rapid antigen test. This is in June of 2023. This is associated with an impressive acute problem with his fatigue and concerns of fever, sore throat and flu-like symptoms. He and his wife both started to recover at the same time, but unfortunately really worsened thereafter with long COVID type symptoms. He was impressively short of breath and fatigued and had an interrupted sleeping pattern. It sounds like his sleeping pattern preexisted his COVID infection and in fact Dr. Tam has appropriately initiated sleep apnea workup where he was found to have mild sleep apnea. I think it has likely heightened and worsened after his COVID infection per se because it is contributing to his excessive daytime somnolence and fatigue. The other big concern is that Joseph does drink a decent amount of alcohol every day who is not necessarily having days off from it. I think this is also impacting his sleep patterns and restfulness. He describes a little bit of exertional shortness of breath from day-to-day but mostly his symptoms are fatigue. He does snore at night and had some occasional apneic episodes. He also describes some restless leg symptoms, but on a sleep study, he did not demonstrate that. He has no morning headaches and really does not endorse any falling asleep behind the wheel symptoms. He denies any cough or phlegm or chest discomfort. He has no palpitations or lightheadedness. He really has a lot of brain fog and fatigue as his major concerns and symptoms. He has also described some word finding difficulties as well. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Joseph did not look in any distress and was saturating 95 on room air. Blood pressure and heart rate were normal. Respiratory exam was unremarkable. INVESTIGATIONS: Full pulmonary function tests today were completely normal. It showed a ratio of 78 and an FEV1 of 95% predicted or 2.98 litres. TLC was normal at 91 with a normal DLCO. Sleep study performed in October 2023 shows mild sleep apnea with an AHI of 10.5. This is impressive enough from his clinical symptoms to likely warrant therapy. All of his blood work up to date has been pretty thoroughly negative. His chest x-ray results were negative for any concerning abnormalities. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Jo Hollohan is a pleasant 68-year-old gentleman with a lot of COVID related fatigue and fog issues that I think are actually probably heightened and worsened from not only long COVID concerns, but also ongoing sleep apnea issues. This is likely even made worse by chronic alcohol use. We had a good chat about the _____ therapies he will likely importantly receive from our long COVID rehabilitation program at Parkwood, but also the importance of trying to get him an earlier assessment for potential CPAP fitting by our colleagues in the Sleep Division. I will reach out to them as well. We will see if we can get some of these wheels in motion and then leave the door open for coming back to clinic if anything worsens. I have done some simple blood work today just to assess for other inflammatory markers, but otherwise, I have not made arrangements for followup. Sincerely, Michael J.

"RESPIROLOGY CONSULTATION (Unverified) J547765 cc: Daniel L. Pepe DATE OF CONSULTATION: March 8, 2024 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Dan: Today, I saw Sherri Zavitz in Respirology Long COVID Clinic followup assessment for her long COVID symptoms, but known asthma diagnosis based on your pulmonary function testing identified bronchodilation responsiveness in 2022. It is good to see her today in consultation to discuss a few therapeutic options with her. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: 1. Reflux disease. 2. Asthma. 3. Ex-smoker. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Symbicort 200/6 one puff b.i.d. to daily p.r.n. 2. Ventolin p.r.n. 3. Lansoprazole. 4. Trazodone p.r.n. 5. Hormone supplemental therapy of estradiol and medroxyprogesterone. 6. Vitamin D3. ALLERGIES: Codeine and penicillin. SOCIAL HISTORY: Sherri is a nurse who unfortunately is on long-term disability from her long COVID symptoms. She is a nurse who works in a managerial role with home and community care throughout London with service to many hospitals. She is an ex-smoker, quitting cigarettes many years ago with a 5 pack year history at most. She quit at least 17 years ago now. She is independent of her ADLs and IADLs. FAMILY HISTORY: No obvious strong family history of pulmonary disease. COVID HISTORY: Unfortunately, she had COVID only once that she is aware of at the end of 2021 into 2022. She was appropriately tasked to be off from work for this and had ongoing worsening symptoms thereafter. She was identified to have asthma based on the pulmonary test arranged by yourself that really did respond to bronchodilator therapy that you chose. This is great to see and she was very happy _____. Unfortunately, it did not improve a lot of her other long COVID symptoms like brain fog and fatigue. She also has some impressive MSK achiness that has been continual. We had a good chat. She has had some nice improvements after seeing a physiotherapist and occupational therapist Life Mart through her benefit program. She feels like this is a very helpful route for her, but was told that she ""plateaued."" Unfortunately, this was unlikely the case as sometimes recovery is slow for many individuals and for a long period of time. I suggested that she really would benefit from ongoing work with our Allied Health colleagues and she was amenable to doing this at Parkwood. From an asthma perspective, she has been much improved from her asthma symptoms of cough, phlegm or shortness of breath on the Symbicort, but has noticed that her cough has returned over the last couple of weeks. I actually wonder if it is more related to underlying asthma as she stepped down, appropriately, off her Symbicort. I had a good chat with her about increasing this back to a more consistent use when she has symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath. She does not endorse any postnasal drip and she feels like her reflux is stable. She has some occasional cough and overlapping shortness of breath, but has nothing consistent. She states she was recently started on hormone replacement and has not necessarily noticed the same impact that she thought she would. She might have for the first couple of days of therapy but did not necessarily notice it as a dramatic improvement. We had a good chat about the next few steps of therapy for her as she has had some important improvements with our Allied Health members in the community as well as some alternative medicine therapy. I think it is reasonable to ensure her that there is ongoing management ideas for her that should continue despite what she was told before. She was happy to hear this. She is happy to join and she is really just trying to get her life back on track. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Sherri looked well, in no distress. She was saturating 97 on room air. Blood pressure and heart rate were normal. Respiratory exam was unremarkable. INVESTIGATIONS: As mentioned earlier, spirometry performed today is much improved from her last test. Her baseline testing today shows an FEV1 at 82% predicted or 2.11 litres. Her ratio was just at the lower limit of normal at 72. TLC was 110 with an RV of 117 and a DLCO at the low edge of normal as well at 72. This is improved from her last testing in 2022 where she had a starting FEV1 at 69% or 1.79 litres but bronchodilated impressively 20% up to 84% or 2.16 litres. PHQ-4 was positive at 8/12. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Sherri Zavitz is a 56-year-old asthmatic who is dealing with asthma symptoms that are starting to slightly worsen after stepping down, appropriately, her inhaler therapy. I have asked her to resume the inhaler therapy going forward while she has cough and shortness of breath. From a long COVID perspective, she is pretty symptomatic still and I think this has not been completely resolved with supplemental hormone therapy. Therefore, I have asked her to join our long COVID program's rehabilitation team with our Allied Health members involved as she has had a benefit with them being involved in the community from an aspect of OT and PT. She was amenable to this. I have not arranged to see her back but she has a good plan for her asthma and has excellent supervision with Dr. Pepe. I have done a bit of blood work to assess for any other _____ of asthma and if those are abnormal, we will give her a call. I will enroll her in the long COVID rehabilitation program and wait to see if my Allied Health Colleagues need any support on their end. Sincerely, Michael J.

She denied any dizziness or lightheadedness Respiratory: Margaret was speaking in full sentences. She had no increased work of breathing, and her lungs were clear with good air entry bilaterally. She cleared her throat often throughout our appointment Cardiovascular: s1/s2 normal with no additional heart sounds appreciated. Pulse strong and regular. No peripheral edema noted. ACTIVE ISSUES DISCUSSED TODAY: Today I met with Ms. Lamb, who was referred to our clinic for possible Post-COVID Condition (PCC). She tells me she first contracted COVID on June 30th, 2022, with a symptom onset date of June 29th, 2022. Her acute phase consisted of approximately 7 days of a sore/scratchy throat, cough, low energy, headaches, and minimal appetite. Over the next few days, she began to experience coughing fits which lasted for two weeks. However, her exhaustion remained significant for 4-6 weeks, stating she would go straight to bed after work, even if working from home. Additionally, she has been unable to go for walks or play in her pickleball league, which she did often prior to her infection. Margaret was having improvement in her symptoms until around November, 2022 when she began to go ""downhill"". At this time, she had a profound exacerbation of her chronic pain, specifically in her back. Since she has a longstanding history a fibromyalgia first diagnosed in her late teens, I asked her to compare her fibro symptoms before COVID versus now. However, she was uncertain if she could discern between the two, as she has not had a flare like this in a significant length of time. Nevertheless, in the past Gabapentin has helped manage her pain, therefore, she requested from Dr. Goosheh for a prescription, and once again saw marked improvement in her pain, only requiring the medication for approximately six months; she stopped it the Summer of 2023. Today, she states she continues to deal with low energy, feeling weak, and a constant underlying feeling of being unwell. She denies any brain fog. Regarding her sleep, she states she never feels rested no matter how much sleep she gets, but denies any snoring or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Moreover, she notes a change in her bowels, stating she will have ""bouts of diarrhea"" and a sense of urgency. She previously presented to the ED in October, 2023 due to associated abdominal pain, with no abnormal findings. A stool culture was ordered, but never completed. Ms. Lamb noted her loose stools to most often be around the lunch hour when she drinks coffee, therefore trialed going off caffeine, but saw no improvements. However, she is able to manage with the use of Imodium, which she takes approximately every two days. In November, 2023 she began to have ""large clusters of migraines"", then subsequently in December, 2023 she developed a significant cough for which she was prescribed ""a dilator and a steroid"", (Covid negative - RAT) and a significant decline in her energy levels, with not much improvement since. She denies any changes in her bladder, no odors, cloudiness, or urgency. Today, her urinalysis did show small traces of blood and a few white blood cells. She states she has been post-menopausal for approximately 7 years; but has recently been sexually active with her husband. WBC may be related to contamination, nevertheless, I have sent her urine for a culture and sensitivity. ASSESSMENT: In summary, Ms. Lamb is a 60-year-old COVID-19 survivor, who struggles with significant fatigue post-infection. It is difficult to discern between Post-COVID Condition, vs a Fibromyalgia exacerbation, vs. another cause. - In the large majority of patients with PCC-fatigue, it is accompanied with brain fog, which Ms. Lamb denies. But unfortunately, there is currently no diagnostic test available, therefore a diagnosis can only be made by exclusion. Nevertheless, since the only treatment for PCC at this time is supportive care, we will proceed as such, while continuing to rule out other possible aetiologies. UPCOMING SPECIALIST APPOINTMENTS: Dr. Basharat - Rheumatology: May 1st, 2024 Dr. Zafar - Urgent Medicine: April 10th, 2024 Dr. Azarpazhooh - Neurology: 1 year follow-up (approx. Feb, 2025) PATIENT IDENTIFIED GOALS: Fatigue Loose Stools PLAN: Fatigue: Fibromyalgia exacerbation vs. PCC. With Margaret's permission, I have sent a referral to Parkwood Rehabilitation for COVID-101, which is a 7-week virtual educational series focusing on lifestyle modifications for patients with PCC/query PCC. She will start on Thursday, March 14th, 2024. Loose Stools: Presented >2 months after COVID infection, therefore less likely to be secondary to PCC (though not uncommon with PCC). I wonder if this may be related to IBS?, therefore I have recommended she stop Imodium and trial OTC Metamucil as directed. She denies any fevers, BRBPR, or melena. No known food triggers at this time. Since a stool culture/ova parasite was never completed, it would not be unreasonable, Dr. Goosheh, to complete if she has no improvement with Metamucil. PFO: According to the consultation note from Dr. Aswald, he has recommended Margaret be on ASA 81 mg and for SPARC clinic to follow-up with Echo Bubble.

He denied any dizziness or lightheadedness Respiratory: Jason was speaking in full sentences. He had no increased work of breathing, and his lungs were clear with good air entry bilaterally. No cough present during his exam Cardiovascular: heart sounds distant with faint murmur appreciated. Pulse strong and regular. ACTIVE ISSUES DISCUSSED TODAY: Today I had the pleasure to meet with Jason and his wife Laura to discuss the journey of his current symptomatology, spending just under 2 hours with them. His story begins somewhere around the end of March to early April, 2022 when his former boss found him on the floor at work. He was thought to have had a syncopal episode. However, he did not initially present to the emergency department (ED), rather his wife was called to pick him. Laura states it took multiple people to get him off the floor and walk him to the car and into the house. Once home, he slept the remainder of the day. He presented the emergency department on April 5th, 2022 for an assessment and was found to have thrombocytopenia (platelets 75), which when looking on OLIS, was first noted on March 18th, 2022 with a platelet count was 63, for which he was subsequently referred to Dr. Saini. Jason states since April of 2022, he continues to have spells of weakness and exhaustion, which are so profound he will have sudden intractable urge to sleep, and his eyes will begin to close on him. It can happen at any time, including when he is driving and has had to pull over multiple times, therefore, he has stopped driving and now relies on his wife to drive him everywhere. He also describes symptoms consistent of post exertional malaise syndrome, such as performing a physical or cognitive task, which worsens his fatigue and may take him 24-48 hours to recover. On May 4th, 2022 he again presented to the ED due to shortness of breath on exertion, chest pain, dry cough. He was found to have a positive D-Dimer (732), therefore a CT angio was completed that did not show any evidence of a PE. However, there was prominent thymic tissue suspected to represent thymic rebound hyperplasia as well as diffuse mild bronchial wall thickening was seen suspected to represent a clearing infectious process. Unfortunately, a COVID test was not completed at this time. During Mr. Lightheart's initial workup by Dr. Saini, he was found to have a strongly positive rheumatoid factor (220) and CCP Antibody (>300) with symptoms of dry mouth, lightheadedness, and numbness in his hands, therefore was referred to Dr. Sara Haig who started him on Plaquenil, for possible rheumatoid arthritis. She also recommended he stop his trazodone, which greatly improved his lightheadedness. Regarding his thrombocytopenia, she noted he does not appear to have Felty's syndrome, therefore cannot directly attribute thrombocytopenia to RA. He continued to work on and off at the cement plant, but ultimately found a new desk job working for Misener Motorsports starting in September, 2022. He was able to maintain this job until September, 2023, but unfortunately had a significant decline in his symptoms beginning in August, 2023 leading him to go off work completely. He presented to Woodstock ED once again on October 3rd, 2023 due to generalized weakness, vomiting, and vertigo. His ECG showed sinus rhythm with occasional PVC's, but overall, he had no sinister findings and was discharged home. Regarding his syncopal episode in April, 2022, I further inquired if Jason remembers the events leading up to it, which he denies. He tells me upon reflection, that maybe he just became so overwhelmed with fatigue, he decided to lay down on the floor, rather than passing out. I proceeded to ask if he came to on his own, or if someone woke him, which his recollection was his boss woke him up on the floor. Lastly, I asked when he awoke, if he felt more or less ""back to normal"", which his wife interjected stating when she came to pick him up, he was so ""out of it"". Although less likely, I wonder if his presentation may resemble being postictal, and therefore may benefit from a referral for a neurology assessment/possible EEG. However, he has not had any subsequent syncopal episodes, but does endorse frequent episodes of a sudden intractable urge to sleep. He denies any diaphoresis, palpitations, shortness of breath, or nausea leading up to these events. But, does describe easily induced posttussive vomiting, often resulting in petechiae of the face, as well as orthopnea. Additionally, he states over the past 6 months, he began to develop brain fog, which made it difficult for him to work and he has found it more difficult to concentrate and remain on task. Jason has been seen by multiple specialists over the past few years, including Dr. Saini (hematology). Dr. Hsia (hematology), Dr. Al-Mane (IM/Cardiac testing), Dr. Haig (Rheumatology), in addition, he is awaiting other referrals, such as Dr. Jawaid (gastroenterology) scheduled for March 20th, 2024 due to previous episodes of BRBPR; he also had a confirmation negative Hepatitis C antibody at Public Health, but was repeatedly reactive at LHSC (April 14th, 2022) and fatty liver infiltrates. Jason was also referred for a sleep specialist consultation and completed a sleep study, which he has an upcoming appointment in the next few weeks. He states the sleep study was completed at the Boardwalk Medical Centre in Kitchener - unfortunately, I do not currently have access to these records or aware of the results. Lastly, Jason was referred to a Registered Dietitian, CDE for his Type II Diabetes Mellitus. I discussed with Jason and Laura his Hgb A1C further, as he was not aware/did not understand he had become a type II diabetic. Lastly, I discussed with Jason and Laura that I am quite uncertain if his symptoms are due to Post-COVID Condition (PCC), as he has no known date if infectivity, or classic URI symptoms at time of sequelae onset, his COVID antibody test is negative (which can only determine infection within approximately the past 12 months), in addition to there is no diagnostic test for PCC, and a diagnosis can only be made using best clinical judgment and process of exclusion. As such, is may be impossible to determine if Jason contracted COVID prior to March, 2023, which also makes confirming a diagnosis of PCC that much more difficult. However, given that his symptoms do overlap with PCC, multiple specialists have been unable to determine an alternative cause, and treatment for PCC is currently supportive care and rehabilitation, we will venture down this pathway while continuing to rule out other potential causes for his symptoms. ASSESSMENT: In summary, Mr. Lightheart is a 50-year-old gentleman, who has been struggling with profound fatigue and brain fog since April, 2022 and it has been postulated his symptoms may be secondary to Post-COVID Condition. Although these symptoms are commonly seen with PCC, I am unable to confirm a diagnosis at this time, due to a lack of evidence confirming an initial COVID infection. Nevertheless, since treatment for PCC is currently supportive care and rehabilitation, there is no harm in venturing down this pathway while continuing to rule out other potential causes for his symptoms. PATIENT IDENTIFIED GOALS: Profound Fatigue Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM) Brain Fog Orthopnea PLAN: Fatigue/PEM/Brain Fog: I have sent a referral to Parkwood Post-Acute COVID-19 Rehabilitation as Jason was amenable to participating in COVID-101, which is an OHIP funded 7-week virtual educational series focusing on lifestyle modifications for post-COVID/query PCC patients. Educational handouts were also provided. While awaiting an appointment with our clinic, he was assessed by the Long-COVID virtual Rehabilitation Program through Cornerstone Physiotherapy in Toronto and has completed three sessions thus far, which are an out of pocket expense. Additionally, I will fax a referral to Dr. Takahashi to rule out any neurological causes for his symptoms. Furthermore, according to the consultation notes received from Cornerstone physiotherapy, state a diagnosis of ?MCAS - I am uncertain how this diagnosis came to be, therefore I have faxed a referral to the Allergy Clinic for further assessment. (IgE today was 153) Orthopnea: No obvious causes at this time. Obesity may be a contributing factor. I discussed with Jason and Laura the significant impact a 10% weight loss can have on his overall health, including his diabetes, and fatty liver. I encouraged him to discuss this further with Dr. Kocsis. Additionally, I will have Mr. Lightheart's next follow-up appointment be scheduled with my colleague Dr. Nicholson, who is our clinic's respirologist. Vitamin D Insufficiency: Vitamin D today 67 nmol/L, goal is to be >75 nmol/L. As such, I have spoken to Jason about starting vitamin D supplementation, which he was amenable to. I have e-faxed a prescription for 2,000 iu cholecalciferol daily, to be taken with food. This value may be repeated in approximately 3-4 months' time. FOLLOW-UP: 3 months in person with Dr. Nicholson (respirologist) Vitamin D (previously 67 nmol/L) TSH (previously 0.3) Thank you, Dr. Kocsis, for referring Mr. Lightheart. It is our pleasure being involved in his COVID-19 care. Should there be any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our clinic.

Her previous symptoms of a brain fog characterized by memory issues and at times difficulty putting sentences together, has completely resolved. Her headaches are significantly improved. She has been managing them with increasing her water intake, drinking 2 to 3 L per day, which seems to keep things at bay for the most part. Rarely, she will take Tylenol for the headaches; however, they have decreased in intensity as well as frequency since her last visit. Her cough has also entirely resolved and has been resolved since early December. She did have some complaints today of some rare episodes of heaviness across her right chest, occurring every 3 to 4 weeks and lasting throughout the day. These are worse with movement and sound more musculoskeletal in origin. She denies any GI upset including any diarrhea or abdominal pain. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Upon general inspection, she looks well. Her oxygen saturation 98% on room air, respiratory rate 18, heart rate 95, blood pressure 114/77. She is afebrile at 36.3 degrees Celsius. Respiratory Exam: Normal breath sounds bilaterally, no crackles, no wheeze. IMPRESSION AND PLAN: A 60-year-old female with diabetes and hypertension, with improved symptoms following COVID-19 infection; however, some residual headache. We have gotten some blood work on her today including ALT, bilirubin, CRP, CBC, ferritin, LDH, urea and creatinine. We will also be reaching out to our research coordinator regarding the MRI head study and possible enrollment for that given her ongoing symptoms of headache. We have not scheduled her for any further followup; however, she was provided contact information to reconnect should she develop any worsening symptoms in the future.

This is in our COVID-specific followup clinic, as he is at his 2-month mark out of infection. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Mike over the phone, he is completely resolved with all of his symptoms. He says his cough and his shortness of breath took a little bit longer to improve from his infection, but otherwise he has not had any lingering sequelae of lung issues. He has no GI symptoms to complain of and really denies any brain fog or confusion that has lingered. He is feeling good with regard to that and the responsiveness to normal. PHYSICAL EXAM: Mike looked well, in no distress with a blood pressure 136 and an elevated diastolic of 89. His pulse was 89 beats per minute. He was saturating 98% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Blood work at the time of dictation was pending. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mike is a pleasant 35-year-old gentleman who is much improved status post COVID infection. He really does not have any lingering symptoms, but his diastolic blood pressure is up a little bit. I have asked him to continue to monitor this going forward, as I would like him to ensure that it is not remaining elevated. We have seen this in some of her younger COVID survivors, and I want to make sure this is not a chronic issue. He will monitor these at home or via a pharmacy where he can take his blood pressures. I have asked him to check in with our office if things continue to remain elevated, to consider therapy. Otherwise, I have not made any arrangements for followup, but would be happy to see him if the need arises. Yours sincerely, Dr. J.

She is also having interstitial cystitis discomfort with urination. Her other major joint issues are related to some neck stiffness and right sided shoulder. She also had some breast discomfort about a month or so ago was sent for mammography, which was negative, thankfully. She is actually finding that exercises made some of these symptoms worse recently. It is not associated with any morning stiffness or swelling. She has seen a chiro more recently and has found that she is more stiff with her muscles and ligaments. Thankfully, she really has not had any issues with her lungs or with any diarrhea. She did take her inhaler as a preventative measure when she was around the time of being exposed and throughout some of her sickness. She has not endorsed any respiratory symptoms or postnasal drip symptoms. She denied any chest pressure or presyncopal symptoms. She also denied any palpitations. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well, in no distress with a blood pressure 126/84 and a pulse of 64 beats per minute. She was saturating 95% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Blood work was pending at the time of dictation. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 35-year-old post-COVID survivor who unfortunately has some lingering symptoms that are in keeping with pain and fatigue. This is of course unfortunate and is something we are going to follow along. With respect to her brain fog, I will send her along to the MRI study for these individuals as well as consider a consultation with Dr. Finger. I will see her back in about 2 months' time to assess how her symptoms are hopefully improving as well as repeat spirometry when she is here. Thanks for involving me in her care.

This is on the background of her having COVID sequelae that were lasting longer than her acute infection. I did see her just recently at the end of January 2021. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: 1. Interstitial cystitis. 2. Endometriosis. 3. Asthma. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Lactobacillus. 2. Folic acid. 3. Vitamin D 3000 units daily. 4. Tylenol p.r.n. 5. Advair p.r.n. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last saw , she has had some response to some training for her brain fog, which is great to hear. She is feeling a bit better and was able to complete our MRI study. She still has some issues with fog, but it is improving slowly. She has some occasional issues with a stiff back, where she feels like at night she is having issues on her right side more than her left. She has actually been trying some topical ointment with regard to liniment oil. Unfortunately, she has been using so much of it, she actually caused a little bit of an irritation, rash, and burn which was unfortunate to hear. Nevertheless, she feels like she is slowly recovering from that point of view. Her other big concern was that she has ongoing endometrial pain that she really has not had for many years. I suggested that we are seeing this in individuals with arthritis, be it osteo or rheumatoid, where their pain is flaring worse than normal. She also states that she has had some flares of her interstitial cystitis as well. We did talk about seeing Dr. Lovett again, who had previously monitored her for this. With respect to her back discomfort, she actually admits to having a bit more discomfort and change in her spine and neck, potentially even shoulders. I do wonder if this is a bit related to reactive arthritis, even though it is not common in these joints. Fortunately, COVID does not cause a lot of commonalities right now, which is concerning. PHYSICAL EXAM: Many looked well, in no distress. She was definitely cheerier than the last time we saw each other, which was good. Blood pressure is 120/77 with a heart rate of 87 beats per minute. She was saturating 98% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function tests today are completely normal with an FEV1 of 114% with a normal ratio. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 35-year-old, post-COVID survivor, who is still having sequelae of chronic pain and discomfort. I have asked her to initiate on some Reactine to see if some of the symptoms are related to inflammation, as we have had some other patients describe this success with antihistamines. I will send her to my colleagues, Dr. Lovett and Dr. Hewson to discuss her endometriosis and possible reactive arthritis, respectively. I will see back in about 3 months' time or sooner if the need arises. Yours sincerely, Dr. J.

Walker Carly Hewson DATE OF CLINIC: June 18, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Dr. Walker: Today, I spoke with over the phone in regards to her COVID concerns. Unfortunately, had a concern due to her possible exposure at her child's daycare. Thankfully it was a false positive. Nevertheless, we chatted about her other symptomatology. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last saw she actually initiated on some over-the-counter antihistamines and found that they worked tremendously for a lot of her symptoms. She felt like her joint discomfort and swelling was much improved. She also describes having a bit more energy, post-cetirizine use. Additionally, she got her first COVID vaccine and felt like that helped her symptoms tremendously as well. She has seen my colleague, Dr. Hewson and Dr. Hewson suggested that a full baseline battery test will be important for for followup. I am thankful for Dr. Hewson's input for . Overall, though, has felt like she has been nice and stable and not having any asthma control symptoms. She is really still on Advair as needed. She also believes that her endometriosis and interstitial cystitis symptoms are much improved post-vaccine. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a 35-year-old COVID survivor who is much improved after over-the-counter cetirizine. I have asked her to continue on the cetirizine as needed and we will follow up with her in September after her second vaccine. She was amenable to this plan. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

Walker Attending/Dictator c/o DATE OF CLINIC: September 10, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL cc: Physician c/o Dr. Michael Nicholson Dear Dr. Walker: Today, I had the pleasure of seeing in Respirology COVID Clinic followup. I am following for ongoing post-COVID sequelae. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with , she is still having some ongoing recurrent symptoms of joint inflammation and discomfort. She states that the rash she had before was gone with her first vaccine and that when she had her second vaccine, she had significant onset of symptoms but otherwise had no return of the rash. She is having a very slow to return normal memory and cognition point of view. She has had some ongoing issues of brain fog still as well as some issues with fatigue. Her sleep is really disrupted as well, and this is a big concern of course. Her anxiety is a bit better, which is nice to hear as she has been out doing a bit more with her kids as well as now that she is double vaccinated. She is thankful for them to return to both school and daycare and of course is reassured that her kids are also quite good with her masking. She states that she got her youngest daughter tested for antibodies, which were positive, which is good to see that she has developed that immunity with the exposure she had to the family being sick. We had a good chat today about what to do with her ongoing symptoms, especially with our Parkwood Institute colleagues. I will make a referral to them that they can definitely help her down the road with a lot of her cognitive events and neurological issues that she is still describing. She is hoping to keep things followed up here in our clinic, and I was happy to oblige. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well, in no distress. Her vital signs were completely stable. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 35-year-old COVID survivor who is still suffering significantly with regard to her ongoing sequelae post-COVID, memory and neurological conditions. I asked her to continue on with her ongoing COVID management at home but to have her reach out to our excellent team members over at Parkwood for further support. She was amenable to this. We will see her back in 3 months' time. Yours sincerely, J.

Regards, Rasha Rasha Abdul-Karim, MD, FRCPC General Internal Medicine RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J1526677 cc: Ryan Dobbs Rasha Abdul-Karim Carly Hewson DATE OF CLINIC: March 11, 2022 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Colleagues: Today, I saw him in Respirology COVID Clinic followup. Unfortunately, she is still suffering from post-COVID sequelae now for more than a year as her infection was at the end of 2020. INTERVAL HISTORY: Unfortunately, and her daughters had some colds about 2 to 3 weeks back. She did serial rapid antigen testing and they were all negative. This was reassuring, but she was still not convinced as she has had a lot of other side effects of this cold. She really felt like she had chest issues, suggesting chest tightness and difficulty with exertional breathlessness. This is on the background of her also having some discomfort in her back muscles. She also describes some issues with what sounded like muscle spasm or a shingles dermatomal discomfort on her skin. She thankfully did not have any rash or temperature changes on any dermatomal layer, but really felt like she had some irritated skin and soft tissue. I wonder if this is related to some of the muscle tension and irritation she has had from her back and her neck. She is also following with Dr. Carly Hewson for some possible reactive airways disease and is scheduled for an MRI. I also went over 's results from blood work from Strathroy at the end of February when she presented for this chest discomfort. I was a bit shocked that they did not repeat a PCR COVID swab on her, but nevertheless she did have elements of elevated eosinophils peripherally at 0.3. does have Advair p.r.n. and a previous asthma diagnosis and I suggested that is something she should go to going forward if she has some of those chest symptoms that she describes. She does describe having asthmatic type symptoms, especially with the cold symptoms she had and that she should reach for her Advair. She does know that Advair takes some time to work, so therefore I suggested her trying some Symbicort instead. She was amenable to this. The last discussion point we had today was about looking at alternative therapies for her. She is using acupuncture and I think this is a good option for her. I also suggested maybe she could use something like massage therapy. She was unsure that it would be covered and I suggested as a prescription it should be under somebody's health care plan. She was amenable to trying this. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well, in no distress. She was saturating 100% on room air. Otherwise, vital signs were completely stable. INVESTIGATIONS: As previously mentioned, blood work performed February 23, 2022 shows peripheral eosinophilia of 0.3. All other blood work was completely normal. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a 36-year-old post-COVID survivor who is still suffering from post-COVID sequelae. She sounds like she had a small bout of something viral that I am wondering was related to COVID, but nevertheless is still having some sequelae of this. I have asked her to start on some Symbicort as needed to see if this can help some of her chest symptoms. I have also given her a prescription for some massage therapy to see if that helps with some of her muscle discomfort that she described. We will see her back in about 3 months' time to see how she is doing with all those issues. I will follow up with Dr. Hewson's results as well from a reactive arthritis point of view.

This is on the background of her last being seen by myself in March of 2022. She has been followed by our excellent colleagues in our Parkwood Rehab unit. She found that these colleagues were immensely helpful. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with , she has really started to improve. This is good to see as unfortunately suffered from significant post-COVID symptoms, especially from a cognitive and mental health point of view. She states that she has been getting excellent care from our colleagues at the Parkwood Rehab facility as well as an acupuncturist that is very much helping her headaches and spinal pain. This is great to hear as well. Unfortunately, she detail a pretty significant and serious concern with her daughter having what sounded like a diagnosis of HSP. I am not familiar with the pediatric literature around post-COVID and risk factors, but even despite that HSP is a rare diagnosis and uncommon. Unfortunately, she was quite serious for some time with her eldest daughter, but thankfully she has improved and is on the mend. They are currently in the recovery holding pattern with serial monthly followup and testing. We had a good chat about ongoing risks and COVID concerns. She asked me about her for 4th vaccine. I suggested that she is otherwise young and healthy and therefore could potentially wait until fall season where the Omicron specific vaccine will be available. I suggested that she still continued to use masking as it is likely going to still be quite prevalent in the summer, despite the warmer months. The other discussion point we had was lingering followup. I suggested that I would be happy to see her continuously and ongoing if there was anything that came up. She was having very happy to have this as needed up going forward. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well in no distress. Her vital signs were completely stable. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 36-year-old post-COVID survivor who has improved with respect to her post-COVID sequelae. I have asked her to continue on being vigilant and to use masking where she sees. I will leave the door open, but have not made any arrangements for followup. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

She is currently on Symbicort 2 puffs twice a day. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with back in the summer, she had been stable up until about 2-1/2 weeks ago or so. It sounds like she had recovered well from her brief exacerbation in June from a travel exposure to cockroaches. This was unfortunate and likely triggered the exacerbation. The more recent one over the last couple of weeks was likely brought on by viruses from her daughters. It sounds like it went through both daughters before her and eventually made its way to her lungs. She tried appropriately to escalate her Symbicort therapy without success, still describing a lot of barky cough with impressive purulent sputum production. She described having purulence in the sputum that was worse than she had in the June exacerbation where it was quite discolored, thick and nocturnal in nature. There was no hemoptysis. She reached out before our phone call today and I prescribed her with a course of moxifloxacin and prednisone. She took the moxifloxacin and within about 24 to 36 hours already started to feel better with the prednisone starting about 12 to 18 hours after the moxifloxacin and feeling as though it might have helped, but was not the key contributor. We had a good chat about what to do going forward in the next few months if things do worsen. She was amenable to having an action plan at the pharmacy if she needed it and she knew she would reach out to ask for. In the meantime, she will know to increase her Symbicort again to 8 total puffs in a day if needed and hopefully avoiding any triggers like she had before. She had a good question at the end of our discussion today about whether or not she would require imaging. It sounds like she does not require imaging and would hopefully resolve along the clinical course of a week of antibiotics. If things do worsen or recur shortly after completing these medications. I think it would be very reasonable to start with an x-ray to see if there are any abnormalities and potentially go to a CAT scan if things are progressive on the x-ray. She was amenable to this. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function test performed by on November 24 show a concomitant reduction of both FEV1 and FVC, which were down from previous testing in 2021. Her FEV1 was 102% predicted or 3.24 litres. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 37-year-old asthmatic who is dealing with postviral issues right now. I have asked her to complete the course of moxifloxacin and prednisone, and we will see her back in the new year if the need arises. She knows to increase her Symbicort to 8 total puffs if things worsen. Michael J.

Some background of her having an initial infection in October 2020. She was accompanied by her husband. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Rabeprazole 20 mg daily. 2. Wellbutrin 300 mg daily. 3. Trazodone 100 mg at bedtime. 4. Cipralex 40 mg daily. 5. Ibuprofen p.r.n. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Dina she has improved remarkably. She really does not have any lingering symptoms of COVID per se, other than some ongoing fatigue. She has found that the fatigue has been a bit overwhelming especially as she gets good hours of sleep at night and still feels sluggish throughout the day. Thankfully, she does not have any respiratory or cardiac symptoms, denying any chest pain, tightness, shortness of breath or cough. She also denies any palpitations, lightheadedness or dizziness. She has no neurological or GI symptoms to complain of. PHYSICAL EXAM: Vital signs were completely stable for Dina with a blood pressure of 115/73 and a heart rate of 60 beats per minute. She was saturating 98% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Blood work performed today shows no abnormalities in inflammatory markers or CBC. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Dina Abou-Chami is a pleasant 45-year-old lady who has nicely completely resolved from her COVID infection apart from some mild fatigue. She is still actively working and having no concerning features otherwise. I have not made any arrangements for followup, but am happy to see her again if any respiratory concerns arise.

This is on the background of him having an infection back in November. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last saw Mr. Singh, he has completely returned to normal. The only thing that is not completely back is his ongoing reduction in smell. It does take a stronger odor item to cause his smell to be back closer to normal. He believes this is still down from previous. Otherwise, he really does not complain of much in the way of issues regarding a chest, neurological, GI, or cardiac. I am thankful for this. PHYSICAL EXAM: Mr. Singh looked well, in no distress. His vital signs were stable, albeit with a slightly elevated diastolic pressure, with a blood pressure 143/93, pulse of 77 beats per minute. His oxygen saturations were 97% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Blood work was pending at the time of dictation. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Jagjit Singh is a pleasant 52-year-old gentleman who is a post-COVID infection patient. Unfortunately, he has some mildly elevated diastolic blood pressure. I have asked him to monitor this going forward. I asked him to follow up with his family doctor if this remains elevated. Unfortunately, we are seeing this in our post COVID survivors.

This is on the background of him having an infection back in mid-November. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Matt on the phone, he has gradually recovered well. Unfortunately, he feels like he is a bit deconditioned, as he had to take some time off from exercise as he was recovering. He felt obviously not great during the infection and it took some time to resume his normal gym activities. He really has not described any symptoms such as palpitations, chest tightness, cough or presyncope. He does have some ongoing occasional headaches and actually described a migraine recently. This is somewhat new for him. His bowels are normal and his smell and taste have normalized as well. The only thing that he mentioned that was a bit new is he has got a bit of right-sided chest discomfort that is reproducible. He actually pointed to the angle where his rib meets his sternum and I do wonder if this is more a costochondritis. I have asked him to initiate some Voltaren gel at that site or other topical analgesia to help him with this. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Matt looked well in no distress. Unfortunately, his blood pressure was up a bit at 164/95. His oxygen was 95% on room air with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute. INVESTIGATIONS: Blood work was pending at the time of the dictation. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Matt Sitthidah is a pleasant 25-year-old post-COVID patient that has improved essentially back to normal. Unfortunately, he still has some lingering headaches and new onset of migraines. I have asked him to enroll into our MRI head study and he was amenable to this. More specifically, I have asked him to monitor his blood pressure over the next month with some at-home readings. He does not have a BP cuff, which makes sense, but have asked him to seek one out in a local pharmacy store. I have asked him to follow up with Dr. Stack in 6 to 8 weeks from now if his blood pressure remains elevated. I have not made any arrangements for follow-up, but I am happy to see him again if any respiratory symptoms arise. Yours sincerely, Dr. J.

Amlodipine 5 mg daily. 8. Hydromorph Contin 12 mg t.i.d. 9. Naproxen p.r.n. 10. Perindopril 8 mg daily. 11. Ferrous fumarate. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with in the COVID Clinic she has remained quite well. She feels occasionally chesty and a bit short of breath with a cough, but the phlegm is generally whitish or clear. She really has not had any worsening breathing escapades and has no restrictions in her exertional capacity, she describes. She interestingly had a return of some rash on her left leg that she was wondering was related to the COVID infection as it looked similar to previous. She put some Fucidin cream on it and it resolved nicely. Otherwise, really does not have any symptoms that are concerning. She denies any GI issues with normal taste and smell returning. She has no headache or brain fog and denies any other cardiac issues. Overall, she is glad to be on the other side of this infection. INVESTIGATIONS: Spirometry revealed a normal ratio and preserved FEV1 and FVC. Blood work performed is generally unremarkable with a slight CRP at 7.2, but otherwise normal CBC, urea, creatinine and liver enzymes. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well, in no distress with a blood pressure of 132/77 and a pulse of 76 beats per minute. She was afebrile. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 61-year-old patient who is currently stable post-COVID infection with no sequelae. She has some occasional cough, but I am not completely convinced it is related to her COVID infection. She has normal spirometry, but is a bit chesty. Therefore, I have not arranged for any followup or have not provided her with any inhaler therapies, as of now, but would be happy to see her if the need arises again. The other consideration could be to initiate her on an inhaled medication for mild asthma as she does have preserved lung function. I will leave this up to her family doctor, Dr. Shewfelt.

This is on the background of her having an infection back in November 2020. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Cristina, she has been relatively well. She still has some occasional paresthesias that have been occurring in her left foot and hand, but it has only been twice. It is mostly asymptomatic otherwise. She has no other respiratory concerns or symptoms, but has noticed a bit of presyncopal episodes. She also noticed that her heart rates have been a bit slow, which is not new for her, but it has been abnormally slow she believes. Today's heart rate was measured at 46 beats per minute and confirmed on EKG. Otherwise, she has not had any syncopal episodes, which I am thankful for. She really denies any other sequelae of her COVID infection otherwise. No neurological or GI complaints. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: As mentioned earlier, heart rate was 46 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 100/55. Oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: ECG performed today does show what appears to be sinus bradycardia. There are no other appreciable abnormalities that I can detect; however, we will wait for the final interpretation. Spirometry was completely normal. Blood work performed today shows a low ferritin and otherwise lower hemoglobin at 103. There were no other abnormalities on blood work. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Cristina Mendoza Sagastizado is a pleasant 27-year-old lady who is recovering from her COVID infection well, but does have some bradycardia that I am a bit concerned about. I will wait for the final report from the ECG that we ran yesterday from our Cardiology colleagues, but we will arrange for an echocardiogram to be performed.

This was an infection that unfortunately she had in the middle of October via an outbreak at University of Western Ontario. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Ava, she has had an improvement of a lot of her symptoms. She has some occasional palpitations and some chest burning on exertion, but feels like that is more related to deconditioning. She has gradually gotten back into the realm of exercise and is feeling well. She has had some occasional presyncopal symptoms, but that is mostly when she is changing from sitting to standing too quickly. Otherwise, she really does not have any palpitations or issues that she is overtly concerned about. She denies any headaches, taste issues or other neurological symptoms. She is a bit constipated that she has not used any medications for, but I have suggested she use Metamucil going forward. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Ava looked well, in no distress with a blood pressure of 116/72, and a pulse of 99 beats per minute. She is saturating 97% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: ECG performed does show normal sinus rhythm without any abnormalities. The heart rate was 78 at that point. Blood work performed in clinic today was completely unremarkable. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ava Sutherland is a pleasant 19-year-old post-COVID patient who is completely resolved from her symptoms point of view, she believes. She had some issues with palpitations during her infection and some of these lingered post-infection. She has completely improved and resolved and really has very little symptomatology. I have asked her to continue to monitor for those and if anything worsens to call us back in the clinic and we will see her again. Thanks for involving me in her care. Yours sincerely, Dr. J.

"RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J1502045 cc: Alexander Summers DATE OF CLINIC: February 12, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Alex: Today, I had the pleasure of seeing Nitish Pandit in the Respirology Clinic followup. This is on the background of him having a COVID infection back in the middle of November. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Nil. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Nitish he has improved gradually. He states that he had some occasional headaches that have worsened a bit since returning to work and believes it is more related to stress. They do sound like tension headaches in the back of his neck and head. Otherwise, he has had some return to normal of his GI issues where he had some bloating and some taste abnormalities that have all returned. He had some lingering paresthesias, but believes he has had them prior to COVID and I do wonder if it is more related to how he sleeps at night as it does not occur throughout the day. Otherwise, he has no respiratory issues or cardiovascular symptoms that he complains of. He again denies any other neurological symptoms, such as brain fog or fatigue. He is back to actively exercising. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Nitish looked well, in no distress with a blood pressure of 120/60 and a heart rate of 78 beats per minute. He was saturating 97% on room air. Blood work performed at the end of clinic today was unremarkable. There is no inflammatory markers that were elevated. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Nitish Pandit is a pleasant 31-year-old gentleman who has completely recovered from his COVID infection. He has no sequelae that he believes is occurring. I have asked him to monitor for any other respiratory issues that might arise, but otherwise I have not made any further arrangements for followup. I have asked him to monitor for his headaches and if things worsen to let us know and we can potentially enroll him into the COVID Headache study. Thanks for involving me in his care.

This is on the background of him having a COVID infection back in November 2020. He had lingering respiratory issues post-initial infection. He had as needed Symbicort prescribed at that time. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with he has continued to improve from all aspects of his infection. He states that his fatigue is improving. He is working out again. The shortness of breath has essentially resolved, which is good to hear. He has not used the inhaler probably for the last month as he has really improved since February started. His cough is intermittent and it is not bothersome. He does not endorse any nocturnal symptoms. The only other symptom that he has currently is related to some brain fog that he finds is greatly improving as he was really struggling with some word finding concerns, but that is much improved now. He denies any headaches that are associated with it. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well, in no distress. His vitals were stable with a blood pressure 125/77, heart rate of 70 beats per minute. He was saturating 99% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Blood work was pending at the time of dictation. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 41-year-old gentleman who is recovering well from his COVID infection. He has been able to step down to as needed Symbicort post-infection. He found that this really improved over the last 4 weeks or so. I have not made arrangements for followup, but would be happy to see him in the meantime, if anything does arise.

"RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J400310 cc: Dawid Martyniak MD, CCFP DATE OF CLINIC: May 07, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Dr. Martyniak: Today, I had the pleasure of seeing in Respirology COVID Clinic followup. This is on the background of him having COVID back in early January 2020. We are following up with him post-resolution of his COVID symptoms in the COVID Clinic. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary disease with MI in 1997. 2. AFib. 3. Dyslipidemia. 4. BPH and severe reflux. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Home oxygen p.r.n. 2. Dabigatran 150 mg b.i.d. 3. Lasix 40 mg daily. 4. Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. 5. Rosuvastatin 20 mg daily. 6. Rabeprazole 20 mg daily. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last saw , he has continued to recover well. Part of our followup today was due to the fact that he had some opacities lingering on his x-ray. He denies much in the way of shortness of breath and is really limited only by his exertional capacity based on his hip dysfunction. Unfortunately, the pandemic has pushed his hip replacement surgery off, which is a bit of a disappointment, appropriately, for him. We went through his x-ray findings today and I have suggested that he likely has some mild sequelae of scarring, but if it is not limiting him at all from a functional point of view, it is not of great concern. He was thankful for this. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well, in no distress. Blood pressure 113/69 with a heart rate of 53 beats per minute. He was saturating 96% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Chest x-ray performed today in clinic does show a nice improvement of that left sided opacity, but there is some mild scattered patchy scarring that is likely long term sequelae. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 73-year-old gentleman who really has limited exertional dyspnea from a pulmonary point of view but is limited by his hip and deconditioning. I have asked him to continue to exercise as best that he can, but of course will be able to hopefully do more once his hip is replaced. His x-ray has some lingering scar tissue, but it might continue to improve gradually over time. I would graciously ask Dr. Martyniak to repeat a chest x-ray in 6 to 8 weeks time to reassess this. I have not made any followup for him but would be happy to see him if any pulmonary issues arise again. Thanks for involving me in his care. Yours sincerely, Dr. J.

This is on the background of him having a COVID infection at the end of December 2020. He was hospitalized for this and required supplemental oxygen. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: 1. Obstructive lung disease, likely in keeping with asthma/COPD overlap. 2. A-fib/flutter. 3. Cardiomyopathy with a reduced EF previously. 4. Hypertension. 5. Dyslipidemia. 6. BPH. 7. ? seizure disorder. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Spiriva Respimat 2 puffs daily. 2. Symbicort 200/6 two puffs b.i.d. to t.i.d. 3. Apixaban 5 mg b.i.d. 4. Atorvastatin 20 mg daily. 5. Diltiazem 360 mg daily. 6. Flecainide 100 mg q.12 hours. 7. Lasix 20 mg daily. 8. Lamotrigine 100 mg b.i.d. 9. Flomax. 10. Omnaris nasal spray. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with in the community, he has continued to recover well. He was able to come off of supplemental oxygen that he had some time in early February. He still has some ongoing exertional dyspnea that is a bit worse that he previously had prior to his COVID infection. He saw one of our colleagues in Respirology in Woodstock that initiated him on triple therapy for his obstructive lung disease. He states that he had an improvement of his lung function and exercise capacity after initiating on this inhaler therapy. He states he had FEV1 in the low 50s that he can remember. Unfortunately, since COVID though, he still has some lingering symptoms that are worse than his baseline after he was initiated on the inhaler therapies, prior to his COVID infection. He really does not endorse much in the way of fatigue, but does admit to more breathlessness. He does not have much of a cough or sputum production. He denies any other symptoms such as headache, brain fog, diarrhea or bloating. Overall, he does feel like he is much improved in general from his COVID infection, but is still having some lingering dyspnea above and beyond its baseline. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well, in no distress with a blood pressure of 121/76, heart rate of 81 beats per minute. He was saturating 97% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function test performed today does show a mild obstructive defect with an FEV1 of 92% predicted and FVC of 128% predicted. His ratio was 55. This shows some hyperinflation with a TLC at 128% predicted with a low DLCO at 65. Overall, this is suggestive of an emphysematous subtype. Chest x-ray performed prior to clinic shows resolution of the air space disease compared to the admission chest x-ray in early January. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 72-year-old gentleman who was found to have mild obstructive lung disease, but still having lingering symptoms of exertional dyspnea out of keeping with what his baseline was prior to COVID. Therefore, we will make a referral to our Robarts MRI study for him to see if we can ascertain any further changes that might be ongoing. He was amenable to this. He is not one litre of supplemental oxygen, but will continue to monitor his O2 status at home with his oximeter. He was amenable to this. I have done some blood work to assess for any abnormalities that might be still lingering with regards to his exertional dyspnea and possible inflammation. I have asked him to reduce down his Symbicort once he feels like he has stabilized out. He is amenable to this. I will see him back in about 3 months' time or sooner if the need arises.

This on the background of him having a COVID infection back in early January 2020. His son, Janek, was present today who provided a large amount of translation. 's background history does include asthma, tracheobronchomegaly and hypertension. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Symbicort 200/6 two puffs b.i.d. 2. Vitamin D3 3000 units daily. 3. Home oxygen (has not used for 1 month at minimum). 4. Rosuvastatin 20 mg daily. 5. Ventolin p.r.n. 6. Trazodone 25 mg at bedtime. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Mr. Dorobek in his home, he has been relatively well. He has really recovered greatly since being hospitalized and is completely over his COVID infection. He really does not complain of lingering symptoms where he has much in the way of chest pain, tightness, shortness of breath or even fatigue. He denies any cardiac issues like palpitations or orthopnea. His GI tract is normal as he does not have any issues with bloating and diarrhea and denies any issues with headaches or brain fog. Overall, he is feeling quite well, but is still quite concerned about his wife's condition as she has been hospitalized for almost the same amount of time since he was admitted. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Mr. Dorobek looked well, in no distress. His vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 133/81 and a pulse of 95 beats per minute. He was saturating 96% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function test performed today reveals stability of his FEV1 at approximately 76% predicted or 1.99 litres. His ratio was 61. Static lung volumes are preserved with a normal diffusing capacity. Overall, this is a borderline moderate obstructive defect. This is slightly reduced from previous from Dr. Licskai in 2019, but otherwise is relatively unremarkable, in its change considering his COVID course. Chest x-ray performed prior to clinic shows resolution of the previously identified opacities bilaterally. At the time of dictation, blood work is pending. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 72-year-old gentleman who has improved and recovered from his pulmonary COVID infection despite having underlying pulmonary disease in the form of asthma and bronchiectasis. I reiterated that he is quite fortunate to have this despite having hospitalization and an O2 needs. He was grateful for the care and was glad to hear that his pulmonary status was not overly different from previous. I have not made any arrangements for followup, but I am happy to have him follow up with myself or Dr. Licskai in the future if the need arises. Thank you for involving me in his care.

She was here today with an interpreter, who was her friend, despite having one arranged through MCIS. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Duloxetine 60 mg daily. 2. Atorvastatin 20 mg daily. 3. Pantoprazole 40 mg daily. 4. Temazepam p.r.n. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Ms. Adam, she is remarkably improved from her COVID infection. She really does not endorse any issues that are relating to COVID, she believes. She has some occasional chest discomfort with deep breaths, but wonders if it is more related to the sedentary sequela she had while she was recovering from her infection. She admits that she has put on a small amount of weight, likely due to deconditioning and sedentary lifestyle, but otherwise has very minimal to complain about. She denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, cough or lightheadedness or dizziness. She denies any palpitations. Of note, she did talk about some occasional headaches, but does not believe that they are any worse from previous. She did have some intermittent headaches before this. She also describes some hair loss, which I did discuss with her that we are seeing in the COVID infection sequelae. It is a natural response of the body distress and infection and should resolve within about 6 months. She was happy to do that. She has no lingering appetite or taste issues and she has a normal return of her GI tract. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well, in no distress with a blood pressure 126/73 and a heart rate of 82 beats per minute. She was saturating 97% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Blood work was pending at the time of dictation. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 51-year-old lady who has greatly recovered from her COVID infection. She has some occasional chest discomfort with very deep breaths, but I am not completely sure that is related to her COVID infection. She will continue to monitor for this. If things worsen, I have asked her to come back to clinic. She was amenable to this. Otherwise, her hair loss is likely related to the stress and COVID infection itself and I am hoping that slows down and resolves in the next few months. We are seeing this post-COVID infection, but unfortunately do not have a lot of treatment options other than time. Again, I have not arranged for any followup with Ms. Adam, but I am happy to see her in the future if the need arises, from a pulmonary perspective. Thank you for involving me in her care.

This is on the background of her having a COVID infection from November 2020. I last spoke with her in November virtually. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with she really has had very little to complain about as sequelae of her COVID infection she believes. She has some ongoing intermittent headaches, but this is normal for her and has not been worsened or in excess from the COVID perspective. Interestingly though she still has an issue with reduced smell as well as some issues with feeling congested. She denies any issues with headaches associated with this. She has no cardiorespiratory symptoms or presyncopal episodes. She has normal GI function otherwise. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well, in no distress with normal vital signs. Blood pressure is 107/72 and a heart rate of 71 beats per minute. She was saturating 100% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Blood work performed shows normal blood work outside of a mildly elevated CRP at 5.6. She had normal liver, CBC, kidney function. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 31-year-old lady who has ongoing reduced smell from baseline. She has no other sequelae of her COVID infection. I did chat with her about initiating on some NeilMed sinus rinse and she is going to do that. I gave her a sample bottle today. Hopefully, this will help going forward for her.

"RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J1529848 cc: David J. Fitzpatrick DATE OF CLINIC: June 16, 2022 PATIENT LOCATION: J-RespCl Today, I saw virtually over the telephone involved with her CPET testing. As you know, we follow her for mild asthma and post-COVID symptomatology, but also, of course, her previous PE concerns and possibility of post-PE syndrome or external pH as the indication we had going for a cardiopulmonary exercise test. She was also found to have very mild RVSP elevation at 25 to 30 mmHg on estimation by echo. CURRENT RESPIRATORY MEDICATIONS: 1. Symbicort 200/6 two puffs b.i.d. plus p.r.n. 2. Singulair 10 mg at bedtime. 3. Ventolin p.r.n. 4. Xarelto 10 mg daily. 5. Pantoprazole daily. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with , she underwent the CPET assessment and it was completely normal. This was quite reassuring and gratifying for to have found out. This is on the background of her feeling like she was told not to exert herself beyond her level of initial shortness of breath after her PE. She pushed herself through the testing and did remarkably. There was no evidence of any abnormalities, both in her heart or her lung, or her muscles for that matter. This has given her a bit of relief as well as the opportunity to know she can push herself when she is exercising. She is up at the cottage right now and she was able to increase her swimming as well as some physical walking. She was happy to do this. Thankfully, it showed that she had no pulmonary hypertension that was inducible on exertion and that her asthma was controlled on the inhalers. Especially considering her asthma, she wondered after the most recent few weeks of high allergens that her montelukast was not necessarily doing the trick after being changed over to a generic. Therefore, she got a no-generic substitution and found that this actually helped. She has also switched over to Rupall and has found that that has helped. She does not tolerate the cetirizine due to some syncopal and lightheaded feelings on it, and she was previously on Aerius. She was quite ecstatic to see the results of the CPET and thankfully was looking forward to having a good summer exercising up at the cottage. She is apparently booked for a potential knee replacement in October or November, and that would likely interfere with our follow-up as planned. I am happy to push her back until after her OR for the knee as I think that is quite important for her to get done. She was amenable to this. INVESTIGATIONS: As previously mentioned, cardiopulmonary exercise test performed was completely normal. It showed no evidence of any pulmonary, cardiac or muscular abnormalities. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 75-year-old stable asthmatic and anticoagulated for previous PE patient. I have asked her to continue on with her current therapies and I will see her back in the early fall or early winter depending on her OR for her knee. Michael J.

"RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J345472 cc: Yasmina Balaska DATE OF CLINIC: March 04, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-PUL Dear Dr. Balaska, Today, I saw in Respirology COVID Clinic followup. This is on the background of her having unfortunately acquired the infection in November but struggling still with a few lingering symptoms. I saw her today in person due to her respiratory complaints ongoing. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Symbicort p.r.n. 2. Pantoprazole 40 mg daily. INTERVAL HISTORY: Today, Ms. Khalil really describes a few lingering issues that are concerning for sequelae of COVID. She still has issues with tiredness and fatigue but also wonders if part of it is related to dyspnea. She has been trying to utilize Symbicort but I do not believe has had the full effect of it as she had to stop early due to what she thought was a side effect of it. It is unfortunately likely a side effect but she thought to rinse and gargle before use and not after. She then stopped the medication because of some irritation in her mouth and lips. I did go over this with her today to discuss issues that occurred after the Symbicort use and the reasons why we need to rinse and gargle. She still has a nocturnal cough occasionally that she thinks in the back of her throat and I wondered if it was more related to reflux or postnasal drip. She feels like it is a throat clearing issue mostly. She really does not have much in the way of chest tightness or shortness of breath at night. The other major issue is her taste being reduced still and having ongoing issues with hair loss. This is all on the background of unfortunately having significant mental health concerns post-COVID. She has really struggled with a low mood and anxiety. She states that she had a family member pass away from COVID and this is of course concerning for her. I also wonder if she is dealing with a bit of survivor's guilt as well. The good news I had to provide her today was at least that her breathing tests and CT scans were normal from a lung point of view. It did note a possible renal calculi and therefore, she will require an ultrasound to reassess for any other renal stones or impairments but otherwise, is unremarkable from a COVID sequelae point of view. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well, in no distress. Vital signs are stable with a blood pressure 129/84 and a heart rate of 67 beats per minute. She was saturating 95% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: As previously mentioned, spirometry performed today shows a normal ratio with preserved FEV1 and FVC. CT scan performed in early February shows a nonobstructing renal stone on her left side and a calcified granuloma in the right lower lobe that is otherwise unremarkable within her lung cavity. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant but unfortunate 61-year-old lady, who is still struggling with features that I am concerned with in regards to her mental health. She describes low mood, low energy and anxiety. Again, I do wonder if some of this is related to survivor's guilt unfortunately due to a family member passing away. Nevertheless, I would like to refer her over to our excellent colleagues in the Psychology Services at Parkwood. She was amenable to this. I have made an ultrasound requisition for her renal stone and copied Dr. Balaska on this to hopefully followup if there are any abnormalities detected on the ultrasound with regards to her renal anatomy. I have not made any arrangements for followup with her breathing as I believe she is normal and stable and have asked her to use Symbicort a bit more consistently and if she is finding no benefit, then it is likely not pulmonary related. I have given her my card though and she can come back and see me at any time if she finds her breathing is worse. Thank you for involving me in her care. Yours sincerely, Dr. J.

This is on the background of her having an infection at the end of 2020 and still having some lingering symptoms about 2 months post now. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Symbicort 200/6 one puff b.i.d. INTERVAL HISTORY: Today, really described feeling like her respiratory status is improving gradually over time. She does believe that the Symbicort is helping. She is utilizing it only one puff twice a day. She is still quite fatigued as she feels like she can unfortunately, only get to a certain part of her exertional capacity and has to stop. She wonders if it is true breathlessness or if it is related to deconditioning. We did talk today about increasing the Symbicort to 3 times a day at one puff or even going up to 2 puffs twice a day to see if this would help. She was amenable to trying some increasing Symbicort use as well as decreasing her Symbicort use. We did discuss today the tapering off of inhaled medication and how to go about it. She was amenable to the plan going forward. Thankfully, she does not have much in the way of other sequelae that she was concerned about such as issues with headaches or ongoing GI concerns. She has also not described any palpitations or presyncopal symptoms since her initial infection and she does wonder if that was all just related to the acute infection itself. She has not had any sequelae, thankfully, afterwards. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well, in no distress with a blood pressure of a 123/72 and a heart rate of 70 beats per minute. She was saturating 96% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function tests performed today were completely normal. Ratio is 85 with a preserved FEV1 of 116% and an FVC of 114% predicted. Static lung volumes and diffusion capacity were normal, respectively at 110 and 91 respectively. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 57-year-old post-COVID survivor who has nicely recovered over time with regards to her pulmonary issues. She has not had any concerning issues with lingering sequelae in her cardiac or neurological systems. I have chatted with her today about an increase and potential decrease of her Symbicort use over the next few weeks to see if she truly gets any benefit of the inhaler, or if it is still related to deconditioning. She is going to attempt that. We have also talked about weaning off the Symbicort as she sees fit, and she will do that on her own as well. I have given her my card, but have not made any arrangements for followup. I am happy to see her if the need arises going forward and would be happy to hear from her if that is the case.

"RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J390914 cc: Hugh Rooney MD DATE OF CLINIC: March 04, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Dr. Rooney: Today, I had the pleasure of speaking with Benicio Angel as well as his daughter, who provided us with translation support, Ivette, in Respirology Clinic followup. This is on the background of him having a COVID infection from the middle of December 2020. INTERVAL HISTORY: Unfortunately, he has some lingering sequelae of his COVID infection that are likely related to his pulmonary status. He is feeling improved, but still having lingering exertional shortness of breath, chest tightness and fatigue. He denies any cough and denies any issues with chest pain, nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis with exertion. He also denies any lightheadedness or other CHF symptoms such as lower limb edema or orthopnea, PND. Nocturnal wise, he does describe a cough, chest tightness and occasionally feeling short of breath. He has utilized a course of inhaler therapy, specifically the Pulmicort, I believe. They were not completely sure, despite me showing him some pictures of inhaler types. Nevertheless, he was using it more consistently acutely with his COVID infection, but has since dropped down to once a week. I suggested that he has symptoms that are potentially in keeping with asthma responsiveness secondary to COVID and therefore we should try to utilize inhaler therapy more consistently. He was in agreement with that. Overall, he has not had many other lingering issues with respect to his COVID infection. He feels like he has some improving brain fog and word finding difficulties, but otherwise does not have any palpitations or GI concerns. He denies any headaches as well. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Mr. Angel looks well, in no distress. His blood pressure was slightly elevated from a systolic point of view of 160/90. His heart rate was 71 beats per minute. He was saturating 97% on room air. Respiratory exam did reveal prolonged expiratory phase throughout the lung fields bilaterally without any adventitious wheezes or crackles noted. I have asked Mr. Angel to lie flat in the supine position. He had no trouble with breathing. He did not have any evidence of paradoxical abdominal breathing. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function test performed today shows the following: Spirometry is normal with a preserved ratio at 84 and an FEV1 at 91% and FVC at 81% predicted. Static lung volumes are reduced with a TLC of 63% and a DLCO of normal at 92% predicted. Overall, this is an extra parenchymal lung restriction. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Benicio Angel is a pleasant 77-year-old gentleman who is still struggling with some mild exertional shortness of breath and some nocturnal symptoms concerning for asthma such as cough and chest tightness. I have asked him to initiate on some Symbicort more consistently and see if this helps. They were amenable to this plan. I have also arranged for a chest x-ray after clinic today that does show some borderline low normal lung volumes, but otherwise no other sequelae. I will see him back in clinic and ask for a repeat breathing test only if his dyspnea is continuing, including upright and supine spirometry if he is still short of breath.

"RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J389114 cc: Soofia L. Kazi, MD, MBBS, DATE OF CLINIC: June 17, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-RespCl Dear Dr. Kazi: Today, I saw in Respirology Clinic followup. She asked to be followed up with her husband because she had some recent onset of symptoms of shortness of breath that were associated with palpitations, lightheadedness, and dizziness. This is on the background of her having a history of hypothyroidism only and recent COVID infection in 2021. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since I last saw Ms. she had been quite healthy and stable and really had no concerning features of any sequelae. Up until about 10 days ago now, she was improving greatly but, unfortunately, developed some shortness of breath really out of the blue. She was with a coworker and was, unfortunately, having symptoms of palpitations, lightheadedness, along with the dyspnea. She had to rest and sat down and this did help things. Her colleague was also concerned as she just looked unwell. I am not completely sure this was related to her lungs, specifically, but I am wondering if this was more about palpitations and issues within her chest. During our conversation today in clinic, she actually had another episode of that where she sat was sitting in her clinic room chair and describes having a heart fluttering and feeling short of breath. I do wonder again if this is related to some underlying tachycardia or palpitations. Otherwise, she is really having no other lingering symptoms or concerns for her neurological/ GI sequelae post COVID. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General looks well, in no distress. Blood pressure and heart rate were good at 113/70 and 74 beats respectively. She was saturating 98% on room air. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a 59-year-old COVID survivor who was doing well up until about a few weeks ago now. It sounds like she had symptoms that really worsened quite recently and could be cardiac in nature. Thus, I asked her to undergo a 14-day loop recorder. I skipped the Holter in case we do not pick up anything. I have instructed her about how this will occur, as well as when we will follow up. Thanks for involving me in her care.

"RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J394690 cc: Natalie J. Lovesey, MD DATE OF CLINIC: June 17, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-RespCl Dear Dr. Lovesey: Today, I had the pleasure of seeing in Respirology Clinic followup. This is on the background of him having a COVID infection back in January 2021 and having dyspnea at our last clinic visit. This was associated with intermittent pleuritic discomfort. He has been using Symbicort and has actually been able to taper down to daily Symbicort now. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke, Mr. has done quite well. He unfortunately has developed it sounds like significant reflux disease. This was unfortunate to hear, but he was hoping to discuss this today. He describes classic epigastric discomfort post-eating but not always the classic heartburn symptomatology thereafter. Nevertheless, this has been brought about, especially post-COVID. It might be related to the Symbicort, but what is good is that we are going to hopefully reduce the amount of Symbicort that he is on going forward. He will continue to attempt to wean off of it completely. Unfortunately, he is having some symptoms that are a bit concerning for word finding difficulty and memory. He has also noticed a bit of his concentration issues have been about. This is something that we are seeing with our COVID patients, and I suggest that he might benefit from our colleagues over at Parkwood and their excellent program and support. He was quite amenable to hearing from them. I did suggest that it was, of course, all virtual for now and therefore would be beneficial to discuss around his work time. Otherwise, he really has very little concerns, as he has just recently had his first vaccine and is eagerly awaiting the second one in September. I suspect he will get it earlier, and I have suggested when he gets the opportunity to book it earlier he should. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Mr. looked well, in no distress. His vital signs are completely stable with a blood pressure 114/72 and a heart rate of 69 beats per minute. He is saturating 96% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Spirometry reveals a nice improvement with his ratio at 83 and his FVC at 91% predicted or 3.47 litres. FEV1 is 96.2 with 2.88 liters. Static lung volumes are a bit reduced with a TLC of 76 with a DLCO of 85%. Overall, this is in keeping with an extra parenchymal lung obstruction that we have seen in people post-COVID, suggesting possibly pleurisy involvement. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 61-year-old gentleman who unfortunately has developed a bit of indigestion and reflux post COVID. I will ask him to use some over-the-counter medications when he has these symptoms to see if that helps. Otherwise, I have given him a prescription for pantoprazole. I will make a referral over to our OT colleagues at Parkwood Institute who has been instrumental in helping our patients recover post-COVID. I would like to follow up with him in about nine months' time after we repeat a CT scan that he had in March of this year to reassess his ongoing recovery post-COVID. He was amenable to this.

This is on the background of him having an infection acquired at the long-term care facility that he works at. This was back in December. He does have a background history of known asthma previously as a child and adult. He has intermittent inhaler use prior to this. He also is a consumer of inhaled shisha. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Adil, unfortunately he has been relying on his Ventolin inhaler much too often. He describes having palpitations and tremors with this and I suggested that because he is using it too much and is not using any controller medication. Unfortunately, this is likely multifactorial as it is an expensive inhaler for him to use. I did suggest that is what is significantly needed though for control. We did have some discussions about his symptomatology and that he has some issues with nocturnal symptoms that are a bit concerning. He does not endorse any reflux or postnasal drip. The last thing to note is that has really improved with regards to his cardiac and presyncopal symptoms. His energy levels have returned back to normal, which is reassuring. He has also improved his appetite and taste. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well in no acute distress. Unfortunately, his diastolic BP was slightly elevated at 141/93. Heart rate was 82 and he was saturating 96% on room air. Respiratory exam did reveal diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheeze that was mild, but appreciable throughout the lung examination. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function test performed today did reveal a reduction in FEV1 and FVC. Ratio was low normal. Postbronchodilator challenge did reveal a change. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 49-year-old gentleman who likely has underlying asthma that is still difficult to control, but unfortunately has had no controller therapy. I have given him a large box of the Symbicort samples and have gone over the inhaler therapy with him today. He did do quite impressively well. I will see him back in about 6 months' time after he hopefully have some more stability with regards to his Symbicort use. I have also provided him with a prescription for him to have this going forward. We will see him back in 6 months' time to reassess his asthma. Yours sincerely, Dr. J.

This is on the background of her having a COVID infection in December of 2020 and having underlying asthma. She unfortunately does not have a family physician. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with , she has been relatively well. From a COVID perspective, she does not believe she has much in the way of lingering symptoms other than some reduction in her taste still. This is on the background of her having lost her taste completely and having it return, but not resolve back to 100%. She denies any issues with her GI system otherwise and denies any headaches or neurological issues or cardiac concerns. Unfortunately, what she has noticed is that she had significant shortness of breath on exertion and wheeze with chest tightness in the early months of this year and unfortunately was likely related to a new dog that they acquired. She did not knowingly have allergies to dogs before this, but was significantly worse when the dog was present and when the dog was given back, unfortunately for the family members, 's symptoms greatly improved. She denies any nocturnal symptoms now, but does have issues with occasional intermittent exertional cough and tightness. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well in no acute distress. Her vital signs were completely stable and she was saturating 100% on room air. Respiratory exam was benign. INVESTIGATIONS: Blood work performed today does not show any abnormalities with regards to peripheral eosinophilia or inflammatory markers elevated otherwise. Pulmonary function test performed back in February reveals normal spirometry, lung volumes and diffusing capacity. There is also normal capillary gas. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 34-year-old patient who has resumed normal function after having allergy-induced asthma with her family's new acquisition of a dog. After removing the trigger, 's symptoms are greatly improved. I have given her a prescription for Symbicort to see how she is doing after utilizing this more consistently. She was amenable to this. I will ask her to follow up in about 4 months' time with repeat spirometry. She was amenable to this. Thanks for involving me in her care. Yours sincerely, Dr. J.

She suffered from anosmia for many months post-COVID and then this resolved. She has had no other lingering symptoms post-COVID. She has had her double vaccines and thankfully is better protected now. She feels like after her second vaccine her smell issues actually improved. Unfortunately, she feels like it has gone overboard now and she is having a lot of issues with finding smells too strong for her. She is finding issues where she is having the inability to discern smells such as bitter and odd smells like flowers or coffee. She has some occasional and intermittent fullness in her nose and she has not tried any nasal therapies. I have given her a few trial intranasal therapies of Avamys today. and asked her to follow up with referral to an ENT physician who might be interested in this, Dr. Rotenberg. She was amenable to this plan. VITAL SIGNS: Stable. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a 47-year-old COVID survivor who has some very odd and intermittent symptoms of increased nasal and taste symptoms. I am not sure what to make of it, but will ask my colleagues in ENT if they have seen this or can manage this a little bit differently than I have the capability to. I have given her Avamys nasal spray and seeing if this will help. I will refer her on to Dr. Rotenberg but have not made any arrangements to see her again. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

This is on a background of having a new diagnosis of CHF and a new set of diuretic use. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last saw Mr. he has been completely stable. He is really tolerating the diuretic use, but unfortunately does admit that he is using it every other day. Sometimes he has three days in a row where he uses it, but he tries to avoid using it when he takes his wife out for lunch. Otherwise, he has not had any exacerbations of CHF and his breathing is stable. He has not noticed any worsening lower limb edema or breathlessness and he was glad to inform me that he has had his third vaccination for COVID. This is great and I am glad that he will continue to be protected against this. He looked quite well today and in no distress and I suggested that from a post-COVID followup and breathlessness, he has completely resolved. He was happy to hear this. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Mr. looked well, in no distress. He is saturating 96% on room air and his blood pressure is 139/81, heart rate of 69 beats per minute.

This is on the background of him having a followup CT as well to ensure improvement based on his post-COVID sequelae. We had initially started him on Symbicort, but he did not tolerate this inhaler due to palpitation side effects. INTERVAL HISTORY: Mr. really states that he is improving gradually over the last few months. His level of fitness and exertional capacity has improved, but he still has some occasional throat clearing and coughing that is more of a nuisance and irritating than it is a limitation. He also admits having a few cats and a few dogs in the house also might be playing a role. He has not had any exacerbations requiring any steroids or antibiotics since we last spoke any he thankfully has continued to follow up with our lung MRI study at Robarts. I will await those results from the clinical research perspective. We had a good chat about trying Pulmicort and Symbicort see if he can get some benefit from inhaled steroid. I did ask him to rinse and gargle afterwards and to see if starting at a low dose of 1 puff twice a day of the 200 mcg units to see if that helps. He was amenable to this. I did have a chat with him about his CT scan and he was thankful to hear that things had improved. Not only had the ground glass improved but also a decrease in size of the 2 nodules that are likely again inflammatory post-COVID. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Glenn looked well and was in no distress. His vital signs were completely stable. He is saturating 97% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: CT scan performed early August was improved showing clearing of the ground glass opacities and a decrease in his pulmonary nodule size in keeping with inflammatory nature. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Glenn is a pleasant 58-year-old gentleman who is currently improving slowly from a pulmonary sequelae post-COVID point of view. I have asked him to continue to try some inhaler therapy such as Pulmicort. He was amenable to doing this as well as with rinsing and gargling.

This is on the background of her having acquired the COVID infection at the end of January or early February 2021. I saw her today as she is still having ongoing symptoms of her infection despite being cleared from a Public Health perspective. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Meloxicam p.r.n. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last saw in the COVID Clinic virtually, she has continued to have issues with throat clearing and issues with exertional shortness of breath with talking. She also is describing ongoing fatigue and some chest tightness. She states that this was made worse recently when she tried to clean her apartment, more specifically her bathroom where she ended up having significant issues with shortness of breath on exertion, chest tightness, described as an 8/10. The tightness or pain is not reproducible but has improved greatly over some time since that episode. She still describes it as a 2/10 right now. She denies any palpitations or issues with lightheadedness and dizziness. She does not have any lingering headaches which is reassuring, but still has some ongoing brain fog. She has had a few investigations with respect to her chest, which include a negative VQ scan and a negative chest x-ray, which is reassuring. Overall, has felt that she is improving since her COVID infection, but still having lingering symptoms. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well in no acute distress. Blood pressure was 115/80 with a heart rate of 72 beats per minute. She was saturating 99% on room air. Respiratory exam did reveal normal breath sounds heard throughout the lung fields bilaterally. INVESTIGATIONS: Spirometry performed today shows a normal ratio and a preserved FEV1. She does have some small airway changes at FEF 75%, which is only 67% predicted. As previously mentioned, a chest x-ray and V/Q scan are normal. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 36-year-old post-COVID survivor that still having some lingering symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath. We did talk about this today and despite having normal PFTs and chest x-ray, I do wonder if she is having symptoms of asthma. Therefore, I have asked her to keep on her Symbicort that she was using as needed originally but use it a bit more consistently. She was amenable to this. With respect to her brain fog. I will send her over to our colleague, Dr. Lynn Rennison, for a neuropsychology assessment. I will see her back in 2 months' time to reassess how she is doing with respect to her post-COVID symptoms.

Wilson, MD DATE OF CLINIC: December 23, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-RespCl Dear Colleagues: Today, I spoke with in Respirology Clinic followup over the phone. She wanted to do this over the phone as she is still a bit apprehensive about coming to hospital. I thought it was reasonable. I am following her for moderate obstructive lung disease on triple therapy. She was recently started on Incruse and has found it to be quite helpful. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with her, Ms. Rule has been quite stable on the triple therapy. She has had a course of prednisone for her sinuses, but nothing for her lungs per se. Thankfully, she has had nothing go into her lungs for a bit. My biggest concern is that she is still short of breath on exertion and presyncopal. I do wonder if it is related to some pulmonary hypertension which I would like to rule out. The reason I say this is that she desaturates without any obvious cause. Her diffusing capacity was normal, but my goal would be to see her post echo to rule out any pH. Also, it would be beneficial to make sure there are no cardiac abnormalities. She is also interested in undergoing an IEA to see if she does desaturate on exertion. She is still suffering from post-COVID sequelae of concentration issues and memory issues, but otherwise is improving. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 59-year-old post-COVID survivor with obstructive lung disease that appears fixed and moderate in severity. She is on triple therapy and tolerating it well. I have not asked her to change any of that. I will arrange for an IEA and an echocardiogram to rule out any desaturation on exertion, as well as see if she has any evidence of pulmonary hypertension. I will see her back after the IEA is done, hopefully in the new year. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

This is on the background of her having a recent COVID infection from a UH outbreak at the end of 2020. I am seeing her today in person. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: Post-COVID tachycardia. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Abby, she has continued to have ongoing shortness of breath on exertion. This is likely related to her palpitations and tachycardia. She states that her resting heart rate varies anywhere between 60 and 90 beats per minute, but when she does minimal exertion, like going on hikes, her heart rate rapidly increased to 160 beats per minute at the minimum. She also has some mild symptoms of lightheadedness with this. She also feels her heart rate so definitely in keeping with palpitations. She does not really complain of respiratory issues such as chest tightness, cough or shortness of breath otherwise. She does believe that her shortness of breath is more in keeping with her palpitations. She has not had any falls or issues with syncopal events. She denies any headaches or issues with concentration or brain fog. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looked well, in no distress. She was saturating 97% on room air and had a heart rate of 92 beats per minute when she came into the clinic. Blood pressure was stable at 129/84. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function test performed today shows normal spirometry with an FEV1 of 108% predicted and a ratio of 80. ECG performed today in clinic does show normal sinus rhythm and a heart rate of 64 beats per minute. Blood work was generally unremarkable that showed a normal CK and troponin. Other investigations were normal including a CBC and urea, creatinine. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a pleasant 29-year-old post-COVID survivor that is unfortunately having issues with tachycardia. I did discuss PoTS with her where this had been seen in post-COVID infections. We will arrange for a Holter monitor and echocardiogram to be done to rule out any abnormalities going forward. I did suggest that we could initiate on some mild beta blockade medications if things continue and she was amenable to discussing this after these investigations were done.

Jimenez, MD, CCFP(E Attending/Dictator c/o DATE OF CLINIC: June 18, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL cc: Lynn Rennison c/o Dr. Michael Nicholson Dear Dr. Jimenez: Today, I had the pleasure of seeing in Respirology COVID Clinic followup. INTERVAL HISTORY: I last saw in clinic in the middle of March 2021, on the background of her having symptoms of asthma and being on more consistent asthma therapy. She is on Symbicort 2 puffs twice a day and Ventolin as needed. Since I last spoke with , she is gradually starting to improve. I am thankful that she has been introduced into the Rehab Clinic with our excellent allied health members including OT and PT. I believe she will benefit greatly from this. She still has ongoing fatigue issues, but this is compounded by the fact that she has a 2-year-old at home as well. She is still finding the stairs overwhelming and ongoing issues with poor sleep, concentration and energy levels. From a pulmonary and asthma point of view, she had a mildly reduced ratio of 69, FEV1 of 86% last time in clinic and has found that the Symbicort has been helpful. She has also found that she has had to use her Ventolin less and is actually using it one to two times per week at most. She is not finding that she is having much in the way of need of inhaler rescue therapy at night, but is having some occasional nocturnal chest tightness and cough. She is also quite bothered by the humidity when it is hot outside. It is quite tough on her lungs. We did talk about that there is likely a benefit to her increasing her Symbicort around the hot humid weather days, in addition to the other important therapeutic options of using a rescue inhaler when she is quite short of breath. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: looks well, in no distress. Her vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 117/81, heart rate 91 beats per minute. She was saturating 100% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: a CT scan done in the middle of May for her exertional dyspnea and tachycardia did not demonstrate any evidence of pulmonary emboli and actually showed improvement of her pulmonary parenchyma being improved in aeration without any ground glass or mosaicism. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: is a 42-year-old COVID survivor with asthma, previous diagnosis based on pulmonary function testing. She is responding well to the Symbicort. I have actually asked her to increase the asthma, chronic therapy in the SMART routine. I have asked her to increase it as needed, in addition to when she is about to exert herself. She was amenable to this. She has asked about anything for a dry mouth and I will ask her to start with over-the-counter Biotene. If there is anything that is unable to assist that we can look at other therapeutic options. If the dry mouth does persist, it is worthwhile considering a rheumatological workup. This is on the background of her having some subtle mosaic changes in her right lower lobe. We will repeat spirometry in two months' time when we follow up with her. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

We last saw her in the middle of March 2021. ACTIVE RESPIRATORY ISSUES: Asthma with previous ICU admission. Currently on Symbicort and b.i.d. PPI. INTERVAL HISTORY: Crystal has continued to improve and gradually recover from her COVID infection. Based on her previous, prior to COVID ICU concern with asthma, I want to continue to follow her for her asthma and her control. She is still having some intermittent symptoms and nocturnal cough. When actually teasing out the cough, I do wonder if it is more related to OSA and snoring. She states her cough really comes middle of the night and is associated with some choking, gasping, or some possible issues related to abrupt wakefulness. She does not endorse any chest tightness, wheeze, or immediate cough at night. She is on twice a day PPI, which is helping her I believe as well. We did an IgE level at last Clinic followup, and it was significantly elevated in the 400 range. This does again align with her atopic features, as well as asthma history. She has had her first dose of the vaccine, which is great to hear. I have asked her to continue to get the second one. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Crystal looked well, in no distress. Her blood pressure and heart rate were normal. Her O2 sats were 98 on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function test performed today shows a ratio of 77 and a normal FEV1 at 87% or 2.41 liters. Overall, this is good control of her asthma therapy. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Crystal Burke is a pleasant 41-year-old asthmatic COVID survivor. I have asked her to initiate on Symbicort SMART therapy when the weather changes and it gets a bit more difficult to control in the hot, humid weather. She has noticed this in the last little bit, but thankfully is still demonstrating good control. I have instructed her to increase her rinse and gargling thereafter. I want her to continue to monitor for any reflux symptoms, as well as issues with nocturnal cough and chest tightness.

Today, I had the pleasure of seeing Mike Slota in Respirology Clinic followup for his COVID infection back in the beginning of 2021. I last saw Mike in the middle part of March 2020. INTERVAL HISTORY: Mike states that he has been improving gradually with respect to a lot of his general symptoms including respiratory and GI. He states his only lingering symptom unfortunately are still ongoing intermittent headaches and being quite fatigued by 1800 at night. He is still working and finds by the end of the day he is completely exhausted. He is having issues now that he has not had before such as going to sleep at the time frame of 1900 to 1930 hours. He is a hypothyroid treated patient and I have did have suggested that we should look into his thyroid just to ensure that this is not that causing some of these symptoms. Nevertheless, Mike continues to soldier on and he is quite looking forward to retirement. He is about 3 months away he believes. He has had his first vaccine in the early part of May and he is due for a second in early part of August. States he did have some symptoms post-first vaccine, but found after a day he had attested it was not an issue. I did update him about the OT, PT rehab program that we have been able to offer our COVID patients and he was looking forward to utilizing it. I will make a referral to the clinic for further assessment. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Michael was in no distress. His vital signs are completely stable. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Michael Slota is a pleasant 66-year-old gentleman who is much improved from GI and respiratory point of view since we last saw him. He still has some lingering headaches and fatigue issues. I have drawn a TSH today just to ensure that it is not anything to do with undertreated hypothyroidism. I have copied Dr. Tetelbaum on this. I have not made any arrangements for followup in our clinic, but have given him my card in case something respiratory presents itself. I will make a referral to the OT, PT rehabilitation clinic over in Parkwood where Mike is looking forward to further support. Sincerely, Michael J.

""" RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J885868 cc: Maria Tetelbaum MD DATE OF CLINIC: March 26, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Dr. Tetelbaum: Today I had the pleasure of seeing Brenna Slota in Respirology COVID Clinic followup. This is on the background of Brenna having a COVID-19 infection back in the middle of December 2020. I am seeing her today in followup due to her lingering respiratory issues. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since Brenna was last seen virtually in our COVID Clinic at the middle of February she has underwent a few assessments virtually. She had a CardioSTAT device performed to monitor for some palpitations and tachycardia she was having but unfortunately has not had any followup from that. I do not have the results from that since being sent out as she did suggest she handed it back many weeks ago now. I will follow up with this. She still is having some palpitations that are more in the nighttime than the day but is really not finding it too bothersome during the daytime. She is still quite fatigued and having issues requiring some naps occasionally. She is also having some word finding difficulties and some brain fog that is continuing to linger. I have chatted with her about seeing our colleague, Dr. Lynn Rennison who is interested in patients like Brenna who would benefit from a neurocognitive assessment. She was definitely interested in this. From a pulmonary point of view, she is improving from an exertional capacity point of view. She is still really describing this as a fatigue more so than shortness of breath but it is sometimes blurring the lines. I did discuss with her the pulmonary function test findings which were good to go over with her in person and suggested that she is not alone with some of these findings and abnormalities. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Brenna looked well and in no acute distress. Blood pressure was 136/85 with a heart rate of 80 beats per minute. She was saturating 97% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function tests performed from February 25 showed a normal spirometry and static lung volumes but a low normal DLCO of 71%. This is something we are seeing in individuals post-COVID. Echocardiogram performed in the end of January showed a normal RVSP with normal ventricular function. There was normal LV function and diastolic dysfunction and overall a normal echo. CT pulmonary angiogram performed February 2 was unremarkable for any ILD or PE. Myocardial assessment of the MIBI scan was unremarkable. It did not show any abnormalities of ischemia or previous MI disease. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Brenna Slota is a pleasant 63-year-old lady who is currently still suffering from fatigue, brain fog and intermittent palpitations more so at night. Our plan will be as follows: 1. Palpitations: I have asked her to continue to monitor for this. If things worsen I can resend out a Holter monitor from St. Joseph's here. 2. From a brain fog point of view I will send a referral to our colleague, Dr. Lynn Rennison who will hopefully help in this manner. 3. Followup: I will see Brenna in about 3 months' time with full PFTs to repeat the diffusing capacity changes. Yours sincerely, Dr. J.

INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with James clinic in a virtual clinic up. He has been remarkably improved. He states after starting on the CPAP therapy he has had a tremendous improvement of his overall function and health. He feels like he is almost back to 100% and has some very mild shortness of breath on exertion that is intermittent at most. He really does not endorse any palpitations, chest tightness or pain. He has no concerning presyncopal symptoms or diaphoresis. He has no paresthesias and his GI tract is back to normal. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: James looked well in no acute distress with normal vital signs. Blood pressure is 148/88 and a heart rate of 79 beats per minute. He is saturating 97% on room air. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: James Torrefranca is a pleasant 31-year-old gentleman who is currently improving and stable from a pulmonary point of view. He has improved greatly from his COVID infection and is tolerating the CPAP well. I have not made any arrangements for followup. We would ask Dr. Elia to follow up with his blood pressure as we have seen some occasional younger and otherwise healthy individuals have some blood pressure, post COVID infection.

He was accompanied by his wife today. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: 1. Coronary artery disease with previous CABG. 2. ?CHF (possible diagnosis on admission as well as a right greater than left pleural effusions on today's x-ray. 3. Type 2 diabetes. 4. AFib. 5. Dyslipidemia. 6. Hypertension. 7. Major depressive disorder. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Apixaban 5 mg b.i.d. 2. Aspirin 81 daily. 3. Bisoprolol 5 mg daily. 4. Symbicort 200/6 two puffs b.i.d. 5. Dexamethasone (completed). 6. Ezetimibe. 7. Fenofibrate. 8. Lasix 10 mg daily. 9. Metformin 1000 mg b.i.d. 10. Mirtazapine 30 mg daily. 11. Perindopril 8 mg daily. 12. Home oxygen 1 to 3 litres as needed. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last saw Jose virtually in our COVD Clinic in mid-February, he has continued to have ongoing issues with indigestion. I wonder if this is related to his steroid use, but nevertheless, he still has this persist despite being off the prednisone. Additionally, he has found himself having more symptoms of orthopnea, PND and lower limb edema. He additionally is short of breath and feels like he cannot come off the oxygen, which is reasonable as he not only has what appears to be a right hemidiaphragm elevation (possible eventration that is longstanding), but also a new found right pleural effusion, more so than left. This is likely in keeping with CHF. This is a concern in addition to the AFib. From a pulmonary point of view, these are his major symptoms. He really does not endorse much of asthmatic symptoms. He is still quite fatigued, and his wife is concerned that overall, he is finding it difficult for her having any motivation. His appetite is improved though, and he has no lingering sinus issues. He also denies any GI issues, outside of the reflux. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Jose looked well, in no distress. Blood pressure was 116/72 with a heart rate of 81 beats per minute. It did appear to be regular. He was saturating 92% on 2 litres of nasal prong oxygen. INVESTIGATIONS: Chest x-ray performed in clinic today that showed bilateral pleural effusions with right more so than left appearance. There is cardiomegaly with improved airspace opacifications. There does appear to be some congestion. ECG shows a right bundle branch block but does appear to have P waves to suggest there is no AFib currently. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN. Jose Gregorio is a pleasant 87-year-old gentleman who unfortunately has symptoms of CHF that I am worried about. I have asked him to increase his Lasix to 20 mg daily. I have asked him to follow up with Dr. Amin next week for blood work. I will make an urgent referral for an echocardiogram as well as for a referral to the London Cardiac Institute. They were amenable to this. I have not made any arrangements for followup, but hopefully with appropriate Cardiology followup for Mr. Gregorio, he will have some improvements of his symptomatology.

This is on a background of Trevor being admitted for COVID infection at the end of January 2021 and hospitalized requiring oxygen supplementation. He was last seen in our COVID Respirology Discharge Clinic at the beginning of May 2021. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Aspirin 81 daily. 2. Ticagrelor 90 mg q.12 hours. 3. Pantoprazole 40 mg daily. 4. Insulin. 5. Amlodipine 10 mg daily. 6. Atorvastatin 40 mg daily. 7. Pregabalin 100 mg b.i.d. 8. Bisoprolol 2.5 mg daily. 9. Janumet. 10. Trazodone. 11. Escitalopram 10 mg daily. 12. Jardiance 25 mg daily. 13. Multivitamin. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last saw Trevor in October in our COVID clinic, he has done relatively well but is still quite short of breath on exertion with ongoing fatigue, brain fog, and poor concentration. He is not really concerned about his oxygen numbers or his chest symptoms such as shortness of breath as they are not related to any tightness or coughing. Overall, he is finding it difficult still to continue to keep up with everybody at home, but he is improving slowly. I do wonder if some of this is related to the prolonged course of hospitalization and corticosteroids that he required. I did go over his test results today though which are very important to see improved. The CT scan as well as his spirometry were much improved. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Trevor looked well and in no distress. His vital signs were stable, saturating 96% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Spirometry appears normal now with a ratio of 74 and FEV1 and FVC of 81%, 83%, respectively. This is an improvement from last clinic visit as well where his vital capacity improved. A CT thorax performed in the middle of August shows inflammatory changes are improved and the subpleural ground glass opacities continue to improve. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Trevor Boyd is a pleasant 71-year-old COVID survivor who unfortunately is suffering from post-COVID with sequelae still that are likely in keeping with some neurological issues. This is likely something that is still lingering and will be much improved and he will receive some benefit from our OT, PT colleagues over at Parkwood. I will make a referral over there for him.

This is on the background of Rocco being admitted at the end of January with significant hypoxic respiratory failure requiring Airvo. He is being seen in followup today, due to his longstanding requirement of dexamethasone and possible ILD/organizing pneumonia sequelae of COVID infection. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Amlodipine/perindopril 10/14 mg daily. 2. Vitamin D3 at 3000 units daily. 3. Multivitamin. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Rocco, just a few weeks ago now, he has done quite well. He has been able to taper off the dexamethasone, which is quite good. He did have some abnormalities found on CT scan that are likely secondary to his COVID infection, suggestive of scarring/organizing pneumonia. What is impressive is that there was likely a nice response to the dexamethasone, as he is feeling much better since being seen today. His fatigue has improved, and he is able to finally catch a big breath. He previously felt as though he was quite limited in his sighs of breath being captured, as he was triggering significant coughing spells. He really does not describe much in the way of other symptomatology, such as pleuritic pain, palpitations, or chest tightness. He is denying any CHF symptoms, which is also reassuring. He has noticed that his oxygen level on his watch dips down a little bit at the end of the day and early in the morning. I went through a screening questionnaire for any sleep apnea today, and he does not endorse excessive daytime somnolence, morning headaches, or obvious snoring. He also denies any orthopnea. We had a good chat today about his vaccine that he had scheduled for tomorrow and suggested that it is likely beneficial, as he is off of his dexamethasone now. This will allow his body to function with an appropriate response. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Rocco looked well and in no distress. Blood pressure is 112/82 with a heart rate of 95 beats per minute. He was saturating 96% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Blood work today did reveal a slight elevation in his creatinine at 124, which is a bit higher than his baseline previously at around 88 to 100. His liver enzymes were normal, in addition to CRP. He did have a slight elevation of his ferritin, but this has improved from previous. Chest x-ray, performed today, did show significant improvement compared to previous radiographs. There was likely some atelectatic lung space in his right mid and lower lung zones. There might be some mild scarring evident, as well. PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST: His PFTs, performed today, did show a normal spirometry curve and diffusing capacity. Interestingly, his lung volumes were slightly low at 76. Overall, this is in keeping with an extra parenchymal lung restriction of unknown significance. We have seen this a few times in other individuals with prolonged respiratory disease. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Rocco Di Cicco is a pleasant, 49-year-old gentleman, who is almost at his baseline from most sequelae of his COVID infection. My only concern today is just to have his creatinine monitored a little bit closely with his family doctor, and I would greatly appreciate if Dr. Pezzutto could do could do this for us in a few weeks to repeat some blood work. Rocco was quite interested in our lung MRI study, and we will set him off for that. I will make arrangements to follow Rocco in my Respirology Clinic in about 6 months' time to reassess his lung function and his possible lung sequelae from his COVID infection. We will see him back then or earlier, if the need arises. Yours sincerely, Dr. J. Michael Nicholson Division of Respirology D: May 09, 2021 T: May 09, 2021 Dictation ID: 6641796 Conf #: 5599729"

He was accompanied by an MCIS interpreter to help us translate our conversation. He was able to understand a fair amount of English, which is helpful in clinic for discussion points. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: 1. ? asthma (possibly irritated due to COVID infection in January 2021). 2. Previous concussion. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. As needed Symbicort. 2. As needed Tylenol. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last saw Mr. Khalili virtually in our COVID Clinic, he has actually been able to wean off of his Symbicort therapy. We last spoke with him at the end of March, and he was still struggling with some shortness of breath on exertion. He was still using his Symbicort. About 3 weeks ago though, interestingly, he was able to reduce down to no Symbicort at all. He has increased his activity levels quite consistently and has Khalili noticed an improvement in his exertional capacity. He has some occasional issues, feeling a bit short of breath on extreme exertion, but feels like his day to day is back to normal. Interestingly, other side effects that are still occurring are a reduction in his smell, his memory, and his ability to concentrate or reading capacity. He is not have any issues with word-finding difficulty, but is finding he has had some short-term memory issues and reduced sleep. Interestingly, he did tell me that his weakness and presyncopal symptoms did actually improve post-COVID, for the most part, but, in the last week or two, it has occurred again. It might be associated with some palpitations, but I am not completely sure. The interpreter thought that he was ambivalent about his answer. He does admit that he has some pre-COVID postconcussion symptoms that are still lingering but, otherwise, he does not feel like things are worsening. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Mr. Khalili looked well and in no distress. His vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 120/76 and heart rate of 67 beats per minute. He was saturating 98% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Mr. Khalili had completely normal spirometry today. His FEV1 was 111% of 4.54 litres with a ratio of 75. He was saturating 98%. Blood work performed at the end of clinic today was unremarkable. Chest x-ray, performed prior to clinic, is unremarkable, other than some slight coarsening of the infrahilar bronchovascular markings. There were no other abnormalities seen.

""" RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J873652 cc: Altaf Mawji MD Jaclyn Ernst DATE OF CLINIC: May 21, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Colleagues: Today, I saw Abdollah Seida in Respirology COVID Clinic followup. This is on the background of him having COVID infection back in the end of 2020. He was still significantly short of breath on exertion and was initiated on Symbicort therapy post COVID infection. I am seeing him in-person in followup. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Abdollah in the Virtual LUC3 Clinic, he has actually been able to wean off of the Symbicort. He has found that this has helped initially post COVID infection, but he has since had a resolution of his symptoms. He did have some breathing tests back in March 2021 that did show a reduced ratio, but a preserved FEV1. He also had some gas trapping and elevated DLCO that would be in keeping with mild asthma. Unfortunately, he has also had some potential issues with either reflux or aspiration. He feels as though cold drinks and carbonated beverages are somewhat difficult to swallow. He does not have any issues with solid foods. He also describes having some symptoms that are a bit worse now with the allergy season starting. This again would be in keeping with atopic asthma. He has had his COVID vaccine, which I applauded him for, as it is something that we recommend still in those who have had COVID exposure. Overall, though, Abdollah really feels like he is now back to his maintenance health. He really has no lingering symptoms of his COVID infection, such as headaches or GI issues. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Abdollah looked well, in no distress. His vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 144/75, and a heart rate of 64 beats per minute. He was saturating 96% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function tests were spirometry only today and showed a ratio of 60 and a preserved FEV1 at 96% predicted. Chest x-ray performed prior to clinic showed resolution of any previous changes from the March chest x-ray. There is no sequelae of his COVID infection. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Abdollah is a pleasant, 68-year-old gentleman who has resolved COVID infectious symptoms. I do believe he probably has some mild asthma, especially with exertion specifically. Nevertheless, he was not interested in continuing Symbicort consistently, so I have suggested that he just have this around as needed. I am a bit concerned about his possible aspiration events and reflux. I would ask that Dr. Mawji follow up with this in the near future. He was amenable to following up with Dr. Mawji for this. I have not made any arrangements for followup. I would be happy to see him from an asthmatic point of view if the need arises. Yours sincerely, Dr. J.

This is on the background of him having COVID back in early 2021. I saw him today in followup of his ongoing respiratory issues. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Charlie in the virtual clinic, he has had ongoing issues with exertional dyspnea. Unfortunately, he had benefits, he believes, with the Symbicort, but he was symptomatic with side effects of lightheadedness and dizziness. I believe it is likely fenoterol component and suggested that we can change this on him. He is still having issues of nocturnal symptoms as well as chest tightness and what sounds like maybe some right chest discomfort. I am not completely sure it is related only to the asthma, but thought it could be related. He is taking CPAP 6 days a week and feels like it is somewhat helpful as well. He did inform me that he has chronic bronchitis history as a child growing up and maybe asthma per se. He thinks he grew out of it according to his mom. Otherwise, he has not been hospitalized for any pulmonary issues relating to asthma. He was, of course, admitted unfortunately for COVID infection. We went over some of his previous history and suggested that we can hopefully improve upon some of his medication routine and workup some of the other tests that he had performed. He is followed up in the Robards MRI study and prior to that showed CT scan finding of enlarged pulmonary artery. I suggested we will need to ensure that he has appropriate followup with this. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Charlie looked well, in no distress. Blood pressure slightly elevated 142/80 with a heart rate of 64 beats per minute. He is saturating 95% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Blood work is pending at the time of dictation. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Charlie Cameron is a pleasant 44-year-old gentleman who is unfortunately still lingering with chronic symptoms post-COVID, but also has possible history of asthma preceding this. My bigger concern is also his pulmonary artery found on CT scan to be enlarged. My plan will be as follows: 1. Asthma: I have asked him to at least initiate on Pulmicort therapy. He is amenable to this; of course, this is due to the fact that he had previous pulmonary function tests at last clinic visit in April that showed a mild obstruction. He was amenable to trying this. 2. Pulmonary hypertension: I will obtain an echocardiogram to reassess his pulmonary artery as well as pulmonary hypertension. He was amenable to this. I will also potentially be following up with VQ scan to rule out any chronic thromboembolic disease. If he has an elevated RVSP I will send him over to my colleague, Dr. Ryan Davey, to assess for pulmonary hypertension with a right heart cath. 3. Followup: I would like to see him back in 2 months' time to see how he is doing on the Pulmicort and go over the tests that include an echo and possibly V/Q scan. Yours sincerely, Dr. J.

This is on the background of him having an infection and hospitalization at the early part of January 2021. I am seeing him today in COVID-19 followup for his lingering respiratory concerns. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Peter, he has had a tremendous improvement with his respiratory status. He states that his oxygen saturation at home is still normal, as he has been monitoring it with his home oximeter. He has been walking a lot better and more often actually. He feels like he is almost back to his completely normal baseline from an oxygen and exertional point of view. He denies any CHF symptoms and really feels as though his respiratory issues are resolved. His only large concern today was the fact that he has had some balance issues post-COVID infection. I did suggest that sometimes post-viral infection, you can have some changes your to balance or coordination such as with the semicircular canals. It is something that I have asked him to continue to monitor for going forward and if he is finding this is concerning, to follow up with Dr. Smits. He really has no other lingering symptoms such as headaches or GI upset. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Peter looked well, in no distress. Vital signs were completely stable. Blood pressure 138/66 and heart rate of 75 beats per minute. He is saturating 97% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Chest x-ray performed prior to clinic today did show an improvement of his pneumonia in the left lung and no other abnormalities within the lung parenchyma. He has stable cardiomegaly. Pulmonary function test performed today did show a reduced FVC of 67% predicted, which is likely related to Mr. Diaco having difficulty performing the spirometric testing. He struggled with the mouthpiece in. Overall, it is difficult to make an accurate assessment of his spirometry today. Blood work performed today did show some mild creatinine changes, but this is well within his baseline of previous chronic kidney disease. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Peter Diaco is a pleasant 84-year-old gentleman with chronic kidney disease, reduced heart failure, and previous coronary artery disease with atrial fibrillation and diabetes. He is COVID survivor who has no obvious sequelae within his lungs and is feeling back to his baseline health. I have not made any arrangements for followup with him, but would be happy to see him from a pulmonary perspective if the need arises. I have asked him to follow up with Dr. Smits regarding his balance issues as well as his other comorbidities. Yours sincerely, Dr. J.

This is on the background of her having unfortunately acquired COVID infection in January 2021. Following up with her today due to her previous history of possible asthma. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Symbicort 200/6 two puffs b.i.d. 2. Ventolin p.r.n. 3. Escitalopram 10 mg daily. 4. Aripiprazole 5 mg daily. 5. Duloxetine 30 mg daily. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Victoria in our virtual COVID Clinic, she feels as though her shortness of breath has been helped by the Symbicort. She has had improvement of her dyspnea. She still finds that the Symbicort is helping as far as when she does not take it her cough and shortness of breath is worse. She has actually probably noticed that her nocturnal cough and shortness of breath has been lingering for a bit of time even before COVID. She actually states that at night she has a lot of symptoms associated with reflux. She usually takes Tums over-the-counter and previously was on a PPI. Unfortunately, she has not noticed a certain pattern to her reflux, but does notice that with certain foods like spicy foods, certain tomato sauces and chocolate definitely triggers for her. I suggested that this is likely also contributing to some of her uncontrolled asthma symptoms despite use of an inhaler. She also has some seasonal allergies and classic allergy symptoms that would be in keeping with an atopic appearance of her underlying asthma. Thankfully, she has not had any need to visit the Emergency Room or have a prescription for prednisone from her family doctor. She also has no other lingering sequelae of her COVID infection such as headaches, brain fog or GI issues. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Victoria looked well, in no distress. Vital signs were completely stable. INVESTIGATIONS: Blood work performed in clinic today was unremarkable other than a slight peripheral eosinophilia of 0.3. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Victoria Ryan is a pleasant 35-year-old post-COVID survivor who likely has some lingering asthmatic symptoms and this is probably in keeping with her previous history of chronic bronchitis as a child and likely atopic features currently. I have asked her to continue with the Symbicort 2 puffs twice a day as needed. I am trying to see if she can use her Ventolin less often. At this point, she will likely benefit from some reflux control and therefore, I have asked her to initiate on a PPI, as well as to perform some nonpharmacological changes to her diet and food intake. She was amenable to this and we will follow up with her in 3 months' time. Yours sincerely, Dr. J.

We are following her up with regards to her chronic symptoms post-COVID infection that do include exertional dyspnea and occasional intermittent hypoxia. This is on the background of Deb unfortunately having chronic symptoms of chronic fatigue and recent hair loss. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Apixaban 5 mg b.i.d. 2. Symbicort 200/6 two puffs b.i.d. 3. Vitamin D 3000 units daily. 4. Home oxygen (intermittent use only night overnight q. once per week). INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last saw Deb, she underwent a repeat CT scan as per the study protocol out of Robarts. It nicely showed a significant improvement with very minimal ground glass opacities of very small focused areas. There has been resolution of Deb's effusions in addition to an impressive reduction of her pericardial effusion. She did admit that she has had some occasional episodes of evening hypoxia where she was saturating 88% on room air, despite having her oximeter on different fingers as well of different hands. She is finding that she has needed to rush and much less though, but is still intermittently using them probably once or twice a week overnight. She really does not have any concerning features of hypoxia on exertion during the day. She denies any chest pain, tightness or pressure. The one time she did need overnight oxygen she did have bit of chest discomfort and her sats dropped to 88% on room air. She then put on a litre and a half overnight and everything seemed to resolve. She has been asked by Dr. Kovacs to extend out her apixaban for another 3 months for a total of 6 months. She is finding that she is tolerating the apixaban well and has not noticed much of the bleeding side effects that she thought she would have. She is still off work as really has no energy and is finding it difficult to perform tasks as well as have prolonged periods of concentration. Just this past week, she has had to increase her Symbicort a bit more frequently due to the weather changes, but is finding it quite helpful. Otherwise, she does not have any other asthmatic symptoms. PHYSICAL EXAM: Deb looked well in no acute distress. She looked fatigued. Blood pressure is 98/60 with a heart rate of 78 beats per minute. She was saturating 96% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function test performed today shows an FEV1 of 93% with a ratio of 77. Static lung volumes are normal with some mild elevation of RV at 124%, suggesting gas trapping. She is unable to perform diffusing capacity. Overall, this is suggestive of gas trapping NYD. As mentioned above, CT scan performed on May 13, 2021 does show a significant improvement of her parenchymal disease. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Deb Sawyer is a pleasant 65-year-old patient post-COVID survivor who is still suffering from chronic symptoms. I actually asked her to undergo a V/Q scan to rule out any chronic thromboembolic disease that she might have. This is especially due to the fact she is still having intermittent occasional nocturnal hypoxia that I cannot explain. She will continue on her Symbicort, which is good to see, and we will see her back in 3 months' time. We also referred her down to the OT/PT Rehab portion of our program that we have just established. She will be a tremendous patient and fit for this program as she is still suffering from fatigue and lack of motivation. We will see her back in 3 months and discuss the V/Q results soon thereafter.

This is on the background of Julian having COVID infection in early April 2021 and having lingering asthmatic type symptoms responding to Symbicort during and post-infection. I saw him today in person. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last saw Julian, he has actually done quite well. He has been able to step down the Symbicort to really only needing it once at night before bed. He has not felt the need to use it throughout the day and feels quite happy that he has had a nice response not only to the inhaler, but with resolution of his COVID respiratory symptoms. He does admit that he is still smoking cigars, but otherwise has not really had much in the way of lingering symptoms. He did admit that he feels like he cannot forcibly exhale as he once did, but I suggested that this is still something that he is recovering from from his early COVID infection. He also admits that his allergies have been bugging him a bit more often and he has been taking as needed over-the-counter antihistamines. He really has not noticed a change to his respiratory symptoms with the humidity and weather changes. He got his vaccine last week and really had no symptoms thereafter. It was good to hear that he tolerated it well. PHYSICAL EXAM: Julian looked well, in no distress. Vital signs are completely stable. He is saturating 97% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Chest x-ray performed prior to clinic shows no evidence of any active disease. Pulmonary function tests performed today were spirometry only that showed a normal ratio of 85 and preserved FEV1 and FVC. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Julian Box is a pleasant 46-year-old gentleman who is continuing to recover from his COVID infection. I have asked him to continue to step down his Symbicort therapy to actually stop it altogether and see how his symptoms are. He was amenable to this. I have not made any arrangements for followup, but have given him my card that if he would like to follow up again because of respiratory symptoms, I would be happy to do so.

This is on the background of her having persistent respiratory symptoms that were concerning for asthma based on her COVID infection. We last spoke with her virtually in the early part of March -- her COVID infection was in February 2021. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Symbicort p.r.n. 2. Ventolin p.r.n. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Lisa, she has continued to have ongoing exertional dyspnea and chest tightness. I do believe it is related to her asthma that was diagnosed today on breathing tests. She feels that she is unfortunately forgetful of taking her inhalers -- I informed her that this is the best way to have better asthma control. We had a good chat today about medication compliance as that will be helpful going forward. I suggested that COVID likely did not cause the asthma and it is likely she has this underlying prior to her COVID infection. This likely just brought it out. She was understanding of this. She also describes having ongoing issues with reduced concentration, word finding difficulty and of course reduced memory post COVID. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Lisa looked well, in no distress. Blood pressure was 147/84 and heart rate was 98 beats per minute. She was saturating 98% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: -- Pulmonary function test performed today shows a ratio of 71, which is on the lower limit of normal, with flow volume loop showing some scooping. FEV1 is 84% predicted. Static lung volumes show normal TLC and RV. Diffusion capacity is also normal. Overall, this is likely in keeping with mild asthma. -- Chest x-ray performed today shows no active pulmonary disease. IMPRESSION AND PLAN: Lisa Morden is a pleasant 50-year-old lady who has exertional dyspnea post-COVID that is likely multifactorial. She likely has some mild asthma that I believe she is undertreating with her reduced medication compliance. I asked her to use the Symbicort at least 1 to 2 puffs twice a day and to rinse and gargle there afterward. She was amenable to this. Because of her sinus symptoms, I have also given her some nasal rinse and nasal steroids. She was amenable to this. I have obtained some blood work to test for any atopy or eosinophilia going forward and we will see her back in 2 months' time with repeat spirometry post medication compliance. We will discuss the OT/PT options going forward if she is still struggling with neurological changes. She was amenable to this plan. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

This on the background of Ms. Lynch having a COVID infection back in late January 2021. She is seen in followup today due to her lingering exertional dyspnea. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: 1. Rheumatoid arthritis, on prednisone and Enbrel. 2. Previous sigmoid colorectal cancer with liver mets. 3. Osteoporosis. 4. Hypertension. 5. Hypothyroidism. 6. OA. 7. GERD. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Prednisone 5 mg daily. 2. Rabeprazole 20 mg daily. 3. Ramipril 2.5 mg daily. 4. Hydroxyzine p.r.n. for itching. 5. Etanercept weekly. 6. Symbicort 200/6 two puffs b.i.d. 7. Vitamin D3. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Lorraine in COVID Clinic, she has actually been much improved from breathing point of view. She states that her fog memory and reduced energy levels are lingering, but improved. She has also found that her balance has been affected as well. She really describes some shoulder discomfort and swelling in her right side that has been an unfortunate progression of a few of her chronic issues. She has been followed up by a few colleagues and I believe is awaiting orthopedic surgeon recommendations. She really has very limited respiratory complaints here today, which is reassuring to me. She really complains of more neurological and fatigue issues than anything else. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Lorraine looked well, in no distress. Vital signs were stable with a blood pressure 147/81, heart rate of 75 beats per minute. She was saturating 98% on room air. Her right arm was significantly discolored compared to her left arm. This is chronic for her and is currently being managed by our colleagues. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function test performed today are completely stable and normal. Ratio was 84 with a normal and preserved FEV1/FVC. Static lung volumes and diffusing capacity were also normal. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Lorraine Lynch is a pleasant 84-year-old lady who is surviving from a COVID infection. She has had a significant set of lingering sequelae that are including brain fog, memory issues, reduced energy and reduction in her balance.

This is on the background of Kathryn really still struggling with respiratory symptoms post COVID-19 infection from the end of April. This is on the background of her having obstructive lung disease, followed by my colleague, Dr. Mitchell. CURRENT RESPIRATORY MEDICATIONS: 1. Symbicort 200/6 two puffs q.i.d. 2. Ventolin p.r.n. 3. Spiriva Respimat 2 puffs daily. 4. Montelukast 10 mg at bedtime. 5. Pantoprazole 40 mg daily. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Kathryn after being diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, she has really struggled to catch her breath. She feels as though this is not just a respiratory issue. She is also having some cognitive issues as well. She does find that the Symbicort is helpful but is having to step it up to 4 times per day. I am glad to see that she has had the benefits of this as well as the step up in therapy. She is not using Ventolin as she has had previous side effects of it and does not feel as though it is a medication that is something she gets benefit from without side effects. Unfortunately, she has had some hoarseness and some voice changes more recently that I wonder is related to her excess Symbicort use but also could be related to postnasal drip, something that she suffered through recently with COVID-19. I did have a good chat with her about ongoing dyspnea likely related to not only her underlying lung disease but also ruling out any other abnormalities. She has no obvious risk factors for PE other than the infection itself as she was not admitted. However, she says she was quite sedentary at home the last little bit due to the COVID-19 infection. She denies any chest pain, palpitations, or presyncopal symptoms. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Kathryn looks well and in no distress. Blood pressure was 137/82 with a heart rate of 66 beats per minute. She was saturating 96% on room air. Respiratory exam did not reveal any wheeze or crackles noted, but on inspiration I did appreciate a small whistle. I did not believe it was stridor per se, but I wondered if it was mucus within her upper airways. INVESTIGATIONS: Kathryn underwent spirometry today that actually shows an improvement of her FEV1 to 55% predicted or 1.28 L. Ratio was 66. This does show a nice improvement from previous PFT testing from March when Dr. Mitchell assessed her. The flow volume loop does not appear to have any blunting of the inspiratory or expiratory loops. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Kathryn Crichton is a pleasant 62-year-old lady who is still having ongoing dyspnea despite having maximal inhaler therapy. We had our nurses in clinic here today go over her inhaler techniques to ensure it was accurate. They had no concerns with her achieving such techniques on her own. I have asked her to increase her rinses with saline starting with salt water to help clear her throat. I have asked her to initiate on some nasal rinses as well as spray in addition to undergoing some blood work to assess for any eosinophilia. Additionally, I am a bit concerned with regards to her level of dyspnea despite improvements in her lung function and having relatively normal sounding respiratory exam. Therefore, I have sent off for a VQ scan to rule out any chronic or acute thromboembolic disease. We will see her back in a few weeks after the VQ, and I will leave the follow up with Dr. Mitchell thereafter. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

She is being seen in followup six weeks from previous COVID Clinic in-person followup. This is on the background of her having some intermittent chest discomfort and feeling lethargic and tired. She is currently on Symbicort 2 puffs twice a day, feeling as though that is helpful as well as other medications which include Aspirin, metformin, pantoprazole, Spiriva and Ventolin p.r.n. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last saw Eleftheria, she has done quite well from a pulmonary point of view. She really does not endorse much in the way of chest tightness, cough or wheeze. Unfortunately, she does still describe chest pain occasionally and is fatigued easily. Interestingly, she had an echocardiogram in the middle of March that does show some mid apical anteroseptal hypokinesis but a normal ejection fraction. It is difficult to interpret the report as the interpretation summary says normal size and function and no wall motion abnormalities. However, in the description of the left ventricular discussion, there are abnormalities found. There is also mild pulmonary hypertension with an RVSP of 35 to 40 mmHg. Unfortunately, the only concern that Eleftheria has with her inhalers is regarding some ongoing throat irritation. I do wonder if that is related to her inhalers and the side effects. I suggested that we can try to taper off these going forward as she did have pulmonary function test at last clinic visit that did show no obvious obstructive disease but some mildly low normal diffusion capacity in keeping with some mild PH or anemia . The other reason for followup would be for a set of repeated chest x-rays. She did undergo that today. We did discuss the MIBI scan as well that we will order. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Eleftheria looks well, in no distress. Vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 128/79, heart rate of 96 beats per minute. She is saturating 97% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Chest x-ray performed at the end of the clinic today does show stable, coarse reticular markings at the left base that is unchanged as well as the left upper lobe area. This is likely permanent scar formation, post-COVID infection. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Eleftheria is a pleasant 84-year-old COVID survivor that is still having some chest pain on exertion with an echocardiogram that is a bit odd on its description in detail. Therefore, I will organize the MIBI scan. I have asked her to have a chat with me after this was done. She was amenable to this plan. We will not follow up with anything COVID related thereafter and I have asked her to follow up with her family doctor. Of course, I will follow up on MIBI scan. I have asked for a follow up thereafter. Yours sincerely, Michael J. Nicholson Division of Respirology D: June 18, 2021 T: June 21, 2021 Dictation ID: 2022176 Conf #: 16974907 """

This is on the background of her having COVID infection back in March 2021 requiring hospitalization. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Sharon on the phone, she has had a clinical improvement on some of her overall symptoms. She is feeling quite improved from a shortness of breath point of view and her energy levels are gradually improving. Unfortunately, it is really concerning for her that she is unable to improve back to where she was previously where she was quite active at work as well as in the home environment. She has a barn and lives on a farm at home where she is quite active with those tasks and chores. She is having ongoing issues with poor sleep, interrupted sleep, body aches, and poor concentration. It is improving, but her overall appearance is concerning for ongoing post-COVID sequelae. Having spoken with Sharon before, she does sound a bit more hoarse. She is describing her shortness of breath still lingering and her hoarseness is worse on exertion. She describes that this is new post-COVID. Interestingly, she was not intubated during COVID, but has had previous OR needs of general anaesthetic in the past. I am not certain, but her CT scan did show some mild changes in her trachea but it could be related to mucus at that point. I did discuss with her repeating a CT scan of her neck. Interestingly, she did talk about her left leg swelling more than her right. This, of course, is also concerning post-COVID. We will arrange for ultrasound assessment there. Sharon did receive her vaccine x1. She had some symptoms post-vaccine and therefore is hesitant to get her second dose. I suggested that it would benefit her going forward to utilize the second vaccine. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Sharon looked well, in no distress. Her vital signs are completely stable with a blood pressure of 107/70 and a heart rate of 66 beats per minute. She was saturating 98% on room air. Lower limb assessment did not reveal any obvious asymmetry. Precordial exam was unremarkable. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function test today shows a normal spirometry with a ratio of 85 and FEV1/FVC of 100 and 101% respectively. Flow volume loops were a bit blunted. There were some mild abnormalities detected on the inspiratory loop. It was not convincing enough for variable extrathoracic obstruction. Static lung volumes and diffusion capacity were also normal. A chest x-ray performed prior to clinic did reveal some ongoing eventration of the right hemidiaphragm, but nice almost resolution of multifocal airspace disease in keeping with improvements of her COVID infection. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Sharon Filippi is a pleasant 51-year-old post-COVID survivor who is still suffering from a few issues including lethargy, poor concentration, interrupted sleep and aches. This is on the background of having new hoarseness to her voice and some swelling in her left leg. My plan will be as follows: 1. Investigations: I will arrange for a CT neck to reassess the findings on the CT chest in her trachea. She was amenable to this. I also organized a bilateral ultrasound of her legs. 2. Post-COVID symptoms: I have asked her to follow up with our excellent colleagues over at the Occupational and Physiotherapy at Parkwood. She was amenable to this. 3. Followup: I will see her back virtually in the COVID Virtual Clinic. Thanks for involving me in her care. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

This is on the background of her having COVID infection and discharged at the end of February. I saw her today, along with our nurse practitioner, Dana Bergman. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Mary-Ann, she is remarkably improved over the last few months. She really describes having her energy level return to about 90% of her baseline. She has some ongoing intermittent and occasional nausea that is mostly in the morning and has actually been present for many months prior to her COVID infection. I am not completely sure of it is related to potentially some side effects of her diabetes, such as gastroparesis or indigestion, but it is not too bothersome for her. She states that she has been double vaccinated now and felt like after her first dose of her vaccine her fecal incontinence really improved as well as post-infection. She states that she still has it, but is intermittently having it and this is much less than before. She has no real respiratory symptoms to discuss and only describes, unfortunately, one episode where she was forgetful x1 leaving carrots burning on the stove. She was fortunate that she did not have any problems in her home and acknowledges that now she has a routine to take care of this. She thankfully has had no issues thereafter. Overall, she is feeling quite stable and much improved after her second vaccine. I suggested that our biggest step going forward was to ensure that she has been vaccinated and to rule out any other sequelae of her COVID infection. I went over her x-ray and her pulmonary function tests today, which are both normal. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Mary-Ann looks well, in no distress. Blood pressure was slightly elevated at 147/97, but her oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. She was having a heart rate of 60 beats per minute. INVESTIGATIONS: Chest x-ray performed prior to clinic today does show no active pulmonary disease, a nice improvement compared to her admission chest x-ray. There are some increased bronchovascular markings that are improved from previous, but still present. Pulmonary function tests today were complete and they were all normal. Spirometry, static lung volumes and diffusing capacity were normal. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mary-Ann Iles is a pleasant 75-year-old COVID survivor who has very limited lingering symptoms. She is greatly improving with respect to her COVID infection and is feeling as though she is quite fortunate for this.

""" RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J1316707 cc: Altaf S. Mawji, MD DATE OF CLINIC: July 9, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Dr. Mawji: Today, I saw Clara Eybergen in Respirology COVID Clinic followup. There is some background of Clara and I am meeting on virtual LUC3 Program at the early part of April. Unfortunately, Clara is still suffering from significant symptomatology such as shortness of breath on exertion, fatigue, and occasional issues of reduced concentration, memory impairment, and feeling """"stuck."""" She also has some intermittent headaches. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Arthrotec p.r.n. 2. Percocet p.r.n. 3. Symbicort 2 puffs b.i.d. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke, Clara has returned to work gradually for about four hour shifts. She is finding herself still quite fatigued and short of breath on exertion. Likely multifactorial, but she is suggesting that the shortness of breath is improved with the Symbicort. If she misses her Symbicort, she is quite symptomatic and feels worse. This really affects her chest tightness and heaviness. Unfortunately, she is also really concerned about her ongoing issues with reduced memory and concentration. She has some intermittent and occasional headaches, but nothing like it was initially with the infection. She states that the headaches are improving. She feels occasionally some dizziness when she exerts herself too quick, and wonders if it is related to her breathing. She feels unfortunately stuck in her current routine, as she is not really improving, but not worsening from a post COVID sequelae. Our final conversation really was about her back pain hesitancy. I tried to answer any questions for her, but she still seems quite hesitant to having any real discussion about getting the vaccine. She states she is only going to get Pfizer if she is going to get one. She is concerned about the side effects or symptoms she is going to after the vaccines. I suggested that she will have symptoms for sure, but she is going to lose the ability to fight the COVID infection if she sees it again without the vaccine. We did have a small discussion about the variants of concern, and she is of course concerned about that. PHYSICAL EXAM: Clara looked well, in no distress. Her vital signs were completely stable with a blood pressure of 135/81, heart rate of 73 beats per minute. She was saturating 97% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function tests performed today are completely normal. Ratio of 75 with an FEV1 102% predicted. Lung volumes are normal at 109%, with a normal diffusion capacity. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Clara Eybergen is a 59-year-old COVID survivor, who is still suffering from lingering shortness of breath on exertion, fatigue, and neurological concerns. I have asked her to continue on her Symbicort because she really feels that it is benefiting and if she misses it, it is detrimental to her. I will follow up with her in a few months' time from a pulmonary point of view, but will make a referral to my excellent colleagues in Parkwood, specifically the OT and PT. We will see her back in clinic, and hopefully have some improvements going forward. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

""" RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J371679 cc: Stephen Wegener DATE OF CLINIC: July 9, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Dr. Wegener: Today, I had the pleasure of seeing Mike Cvetkovich in Respirology COVID clinic followup. This is on the background of Mike having unfortunately some lingering symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigability. Unfortunately, he also describing some other symptoms such as balance issues, cognitive impairments, such as word finding difficulties and poor concentration. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Symbicort p.r.n. (discontinued due to side effects). 2. Desvenlafaxine 150 mg daily. 3. Gabapentin 900 mg q.h.s. 4. Flomax p.r.n. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Mike in our virtual clinic just a few weeks ago now he has improved gradually. He is stating that his fatigue is slowly improving but he is still quite foggy and sleepy in the morning. He also describes some balance issues throughout the day that are somewhat new for him. He states that his breathing is much better and this is good to hear. He has not had to reach for the Symbicort inhaler since we spoke last. This is reassuring as well especially with the hot humid weather. We did talk about the COVID sequelae that he is likely suffering from and he is interested in attending our OT, PT program at Parkwood. He was very amenable to having ongoing followup for the concentration and neurological symptoms. PHYSICAL EXAM: Michael looked well in no distress. His vital signs were completely stable. Blood pressure is 124/79, heart rate is 68 beats per minute. He is saturating on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Spirometry reveals a ratio of 77 and FEV1 123% predicted or 3.93 liters. Overall, normal spirometry. A chest x-ray performed prior to clinic today does show a nice resolution of his upper lung zone opacifications. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mike Cvetkovich is a pleasant 63-year-old gentleman who has some lingering COVID sequelae still. I believe he would completely benefit from our supportive Allied Health members at Parkwood. Therefore, I will make a referral for OT, PT to help him with his cognition, concentration issues as well as balance and physical attributes. I have done some blood work at the end of clinic today and it thankfully shows a resolution of his transaminitis. This is likely all related to his viral COVID infection. I have not made any arrangements for followup with Mike in our COVID clinic but would be happy to see him again if the need arises. He will be well served in the OT, PT program at Parkwood.

This is on the background of her having a COVID infection the end of April 2021. CURRENT RESPIRATORY MEDICATIONS: Symbicort p.r.n. (was using it up until about a week ago). INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Stephanie in our virtual clinic, she has maintained improvement over the last few weeks. She did have a diagnosis of asthma as a child and really found the Symbicort quite beneficial to her. She only really just started to wean it off the last week or so as she felt like she was finally recovered back to baseline. This is good to hear as it definitely improved her cough and dyspnea. She is back to work and not having any lingering neurological symptoms. Her GI system is normal, and her headaches are back to her previous baseline. Unfortunately, she does have a previous history of headaches, but there are not any worse. She has had some occasional palpitations, and I believe Dr. Abdul-Karim has ordered a 2-week Holter monitor for her. She just sent it back in, so she will await the results from that. Otherwise, she has found that her palpitations are not overwhelming right now. VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure is slightly up at 141/93 with a heart rate of 71 beats per minute. She was saturating 96 on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: 1. Pulmonary function tests performed today are completely normal. Ratio was 83 with an FEV1 of 98% predicted or 2.69 litres. TLC is normal at 88% predicted, and DLCO of 90%, which is normal. Overall, normal PFTs. 2. Chest x-ray is consistent with improvement of her previous COVID-related pneumonia. This is reassuring. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Stephanie Laurence is a pleasant 51-year-old COVID survivor who is returning to normal. She has been able to wean off of her Symbicort well, and I congratulated her on this. I have not made any arrangements for followup with us in the Respirology Clinic, but Dr. Abdul-Karim, I imagine will follow up with her with regards to the Holter monitor. I have asked her to continue on her Symbicort as needed going forward, especially post-COVID, as she has a previous history of asthma. She was amenable to this. I will see her again if the need arises going forward. Yours sincerely, Michael J. Nicholson Division of Respirology D: July 9, 2021 T: July 11, 2021 Dictation ID: 2206206 Conf #: 19076832"

McKay DATE OF CLINIC: March 11, 2022 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Dr. McKay: Today, I spoke with Belinda Wilson over the phone in Respirology COVID Clinic followup. This is on the background of her last being assessed by my colleague Dana Bergman at the end of October 2021. This is coming from her having an infection at the beginning of 2021. COVID infection at the beginning of 2021. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Belinda in the COVID Clinic followup. She has had some improvements going forward. She is linked into our Parkwood Program for rehabilitation. This is great to see and I think she is already starting to see some of the benefits. She has also unfortunately having some vague symptoms such as restless leg and this might be linked in to her loose bowel motions. She has essentially loose set of bowel motions since COVID. I suggested that this can definitely drop some of her electrolyte levels, specifically like magnesium, that can lead to restless leg. I have asked her to initiate on some probiotics to see if this can help some of her bowel irritation, but also potentially supplement, magnesium in her diet or over-the-counter medications. She was amenable to this. From a cognitive point of view, she is very interested in how she is going to progress through the Parkwood program and I of course suggested that they are fantastic in their job and her ability to help people through this. From a pulmonary point of view, she really has minimal symptoms, which is great to see. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Belinda Wilson is a pleasant 55-year-old post-COVID survivor that is improving gradually. She is linked into our Parkwood Program, which is great to see. From a diarrhea point of view, I have asked her to start on some probiotics to see if this can help re-regulate her bowel and microbiome. This will hopefully help potentially reduce the loss of magnesium that she might be having that is potentially contributing to her restless leg syndrome. If not, I have asked her to touch base with Dr. McKay to consider alternative restless leg symptom therapies as well as to potentially assess her magnesium level going forward. I have not made any arrangements in the post-COVID Clinic here at St. Joe's, but will wait to see if our Parkwood colleagues have any further assessment they require on our end.

"RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J1549654 cc: Megan Devlin, MD Erin Spicer Marko Mrkobrada, MD, FRCPC DATE OF CLINIC: October 22, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Colleagues: Romio is a pleasant 56-year-old gentleman seen today at the COVID-19 Clinic for followup. DATE OF SYMPTOM ONSET: May 17, 2021. DATE OF FIRST POSITIVE COVID SWAB: May 19, 2021. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. COVID-19 pneumonia: He was hospitalized and required an air bulb but was never intubated. He received a course of dexamethasone and antibiotics in the hospital and also received one dose of tocilizumab. He was then seen immediately post-discharge on June 2021, 2021, and at that time was not doing well, so he was given another course of prednisone 40 mg for one week. He completed this course and saw Dr. Spicer on June 7, 2021. At that time, it was also noted that he was not doing well, was given another course taper of prednisone, which completed a course on July 7, 2021. He also had a 2-week course of azithromycin Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for anti-inflammatory properties post completion of taper. 2. GERD. 3. Hypothyroidism. 4. Hypertension. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Vitamin D3 1000 units daily. 2. Multivitamins. 3. Levothyroxine 125 mcg daily. 4. Pantoloc 40 mg daily. 5. Amlodipine - perindopril 5-7 mg tablet daily. INTERVAL HISTORY: Romio was last seen by Dr. Devlin at the COVID-19 Clinic via telephone on August 11, 2021. At that time, he seemed to have ongoing fatigue and some leg swelling but overall was improving. He also had some bilateral airspace opacities on his chest x-ray. Today, he reports that overall he is doing much better and he is back to work for the past month. He is not limited at work. He is seen with his wife and a translator present. He can walk up to a few kilometres and stops more because of tiredness as opposed to dyspnea. He stops to rest for a brief minute or two and then he can start walking again. He is also doing better with the stairs. He does not have any significant chest discomfort or wheezing and he denies coughing. He also reports that his fatigue is getting better. He still feels quite tired and is not 100% compared to prior to COVID-19 pneumonia, but is getting generally better and much better than the last few months. In terms of cognitive dysfunction, his wife reports that he does have some short-term memory issues where he is forgetting his phone outside, for example, and minor things like that. However, he has not had any issues at work. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: At the time of assessment, he appears comfortable. His temperature is 36.9, pulse is 99, respiratory rate 18, blood pressure is 134/86 and he is 96% on room air. He was previously on home oxygen, which was discontinued a couple months ago. His lungs are clear with equal air entry bilaterally. Heart sounds are normal S1, S2 with no added sounds or murmurs appreciated. There is 1+ peripheral edema and bilaterally in the lower limbs. RELEVANT INVESTIGATIONS: His chest x-ray today compared to his chest x-ray in July shows a significant improvement of diffuse airspace opacities. He still has some peripheral patchy opacities diffusely, but significantly improved. In terms of breathing test today, he was not able to accurately perform PFTs and they were not up to ATS criteria. His FEV1 was 55% predicted with an FVC of 43% predicted, and a ratio of 98, which is indicative of a nonspecific ventilatory defect. His TLC was also 56% predicted today and RV was 74% predicted. His DLCO was 144% predicted. Once again, these PFTs are not accurate, given that they were not up to ATS criteria; however, it is reassuring that his DLCO was not reduced. IMPRESSION AND PLAN: In summary, Romio is a pleasant 56-year-old gentleman post COVID-19 pneumonia requiring 3 courses of prednisone and home oxygen for a few months. He is now mostly recovered and getting close to baseline. He does have some ongoing fatigue as well as some short short-term memory issues, but overall feeling well. We discussed a referral to the Parkwood Rehab program, but at this time he will continue to go back to work and do the normal things that he is doing as things are getting better. PLAN: 1. We will obtain COVID-related blood work today including CRP, ferritin, total bilirubin, ALT, LDH, as well as a CBC. 2. We have not organized a followup with Romio at the clinic. We have advised him to call us if his breathing gets worse or he needs to be seen again. Thank you for involving us in the care of Romio. Sincerely yours, Ali Malik Resident for J.

"RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J1488368 cc: Sophia Anthireya- Kakani DATE OF CLINIC: December 17, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Sophia, Today, I had the pleasure of seeing Ricardo in Respirology COVID Clinic followup for his asthma and post-COVID sequelae. This is on the background of us last seeing him at the end of October 2021. He remains on his inhalers of Symbicort 1 puff b.i.d. and as-needed Ventolin. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Ricardo, he has maintained improved health from a pulmonary perspective. He is less short of breath and his energy levels are increasing. He still has some occasional left-sided discomfort with his exertion and after a little bit more digging, he actually describes some chest discomfort. This is all on the background of him actually then revealing to me that he was diagnosed with some sort of congenital heart abnormality. He described something to do with a blood vessel that is abnormal. This, of course, concerned me a bit that he is having chest symptoms that are sounding more cardiac in nature then pulmonary and him having a congenital heart defect. I suggested that he speak with Dr. Anthireya-Kakani quickly about this and to have further investigations. I actually wrote down that he should have investigations that include either a Bruce treadmill protocol for ischemia or a MIBI scan. Additionally, even an echo would be beneficial. I suggested from a pulmonary perspective, the fact that he is stable, this is reassuring and that he should continue on his Symbicort 1 or 2 puffs twice a day. He can then even try to wean off them completely if he feels like he is stable enough. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Ricardo unfortunately was hypertensive here in clinic today at 156/105, saturating 96% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: CT thorax performed at the end of November shows nice resolution of previous nodules and ground-glass opacities. There is stability of his mediastinal lymphadenopathy that is still likely reactive and stable granulomas that are not concerning. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ricardo Chamorro Echeverry is a pleasant 51-year-old gentleman who informs me today that he has a congenital heart history from many years ago and is having some chest discomfort that is a bit concerning for something more than pulmonary in nature. I suggested that he follow up with his family doctor about looking at either a MIBI scan or a Bruce treadmill test for further assessments. From a COVID and asthma point of view, he is stable. I have asked him to continue on with his inhalers as he sees fit with either 1 puff twice a day, 2 puffs twice a day or as needed. I have not made any arrangements for followup, but would be happy to see Ricardo in the future if a pulmonary need arises. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

Vitals: 36.8C, HR 72 supine, 76 standing; BP 105/70 supine, 104/64 standing; RR 18, SpO2 97%, 75 kg. INVESTIGATIONS: 1. CXR (November 5, 2021) – Normal. 2. PFTs (November 5, 2021) – Normal. FEV1 116%, FVC 120%, ratio 95%. DLCO not ordered. 3. Bloodwork (November 5, 2021) – completed labs requested by Dr. Bruckschwaiger with the addition of TSH, liver functions, cholesterol (as patient had fasted), inflammatory markers, serum testosterone, and vitamin D levels. Notable for vitamin D insufficiency (60 nmol/L; reference range 75 – 250). ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 1. Lung function: John’s lung functions have normalized. 2. Vaccination: John and I spoke at length regarding mRNA vaccination against COVID. We discussed the mechanism of the vaccine as well as safety and efficacy. John states he is not against vaccination, just uneasy taking a newer agent. He expressed interest in going South this winter, so I reminded him of the requirements for such travel. There was a spare Pfizer dose in clinic which was offered to him, but he declined at that time. He remains unvaccinated. I hope he reconsiders. 3. Blood work: as he was already present, John was agreeable to get his blood work drawn in clinic. We discussed the addition of inflammatory markers, liver functions, and select hormone levels, as well as vitamin D levels. He was agreeable to the extended panel. His results were discussed with him by phone on November 10, 1145h, and he was agreeable to vitamin D repletion. This was sent to his pharmacy electronically as vitamin D3 10,000 IU daily for three weeks, then 2000 IU daily over the winter. Given his adequate oral intake and sun exposure over the summer, this insufficiency is a bit puzzling. Dr. Bruckschwaiger, kindly consider follow up blood work in the spring with a repeat vitamin D, calcium, and PTH. Consideration could be made for folate, B12, and celiac screen as well. 4. Follow up: John is doing reasonably well and has been discharged from the post-acute COVID clinic. That said, if issues arise, we’d happily see him again.

Altered smell and taste: Shannon was shy to mention the on-going lack of smell and altered taste. However, it is impacting his quality of life, and that of his wife. He’s been provided with the AbScent guide to olfactory training, as this is an intervention that has had some modest success with regaining the sense of smell. 3. Hair loss: Shannon has been reassured his hair loss is temporary and related to his COVID infection. This was reassuring to him. 4. Diagnostic results: Shannon already takes 3000 IU vitamin D3 daily, so his levels will replete in time. His testosterone will also begin to rebound over time as his Leydig cells regenerate. His chest x-ray is clear. 5. Disposition: Shannon is doing well. We will see him back once more to see how he is faring, and to complete PFTs, and then consider discharge from the program.

Chest X-ray (November 19, 2021) – Improvement in the lung parenchyma; only residual abnormality is a minor linear density in right midlung laterally. No consolidation or effusions. 2. Pulmonary function tests (November 19, 2021): Actual % predicted FEV1 (L) 3.29 118 FVC (L) 3.86 119 FEV1/FVC (%) 85 99 TLC (Pleth, L) 5.01 102 RV (Pleth, L) 1.17 97 RV/TLC 23 78 DLCO (mL/min/mmHg) 24.78 93 3. Blood work (November 19, 2021) – Normal apart from serum 25 – vitamin D 39 nmol/L. ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 1. Blood work: Zuhairah reported she had a follow up appointment booked with her GP for late November, and wondered if she could have her blood draw done at SJHC. With her permission, some other investigations were added including CRP and serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D. Vitamin D levels came back as 39 nmol/L (15 ng/mL). Deficiency has variable lowest thresholds, but a sizable portion of authors define it as serum 25vitD less than 75 nmol/L (StatPearls, Endocrine Society, etc.). Zu was quite ill in the spring, but had improved enough to be back to work, fitness, and outdoor activity. Despite solar exposure, she remains deficient. Given her dark skin and recent illness, her lipid stores of vitamin D will be replenished with 10,000 IU daily vitamin D3 for a month, followed by 2000 IU daily over the winter. Dr. Kolecki, if you would kindly check Zu’s 25vitD and calcium level in the spring to demonstrate repletion. 2. Fatigue/endurance: The schedule Zu describes involves working full time as an RN, Tabata drills 3 – 4 days a week, and caring for a one-year-old. I’ve encouraged Zu to slow down her exercise intensity and pace her activities, as her body is still recovering from a serious illness. 3. Disposition: Zuhairah has recovered quite well. No follow up has been booked and she has returned to the care of her primary care physician. We wish her the best. Regards, Dana Bergman, MN, NP Post-Acute COVID Program SJHC London"
"RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J812223 cc: Peter Dzongowski, MD Carly Hewson DATE OF CLINIC: November 19, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Colleagues: Today, I had the pleasure of seeing Beata Pedda in Respirology COVID Clinic follow-up. She was last seen at the end of August 2021 for post-COVID sequelae of dyspnea as well as fatigue. She is also unfortunately suffering from significant small joint stiffness, swelling, and erythema that has occurred post-COVID infection. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Beata in clinic, she has continued to improve her shortness of breath and fatigue on exertion. Unfortunately, she is still suffering from muscle aches and pains within her joints, but specifically her small joints of her hands and wrists. She is having some occasional stiffness and muscle aches in her lower limbs as well. My colleague, Dr. Khalil Karim, did a CK level at last clinic visit that was unremarkable. She did notice some elevated transaminases that I have repeated today in clinic that are normal. Symbicort is definitely something she benefitted from over the summer, but has been able to taper down on it more recently. I suggested that this is likely in keeping with not only her reactive airways post-infection, but also in keeping with some mild asthma possibly. This is the correct route for her in management from a post-COVID reactive airways problem. PHYSICAL EXAM: Beata looked well, in no distress. Her vital signs were completely stable, saturating 98% on room air, with normal heart rate and blood pressure. INVESTIGATIONS: As previously mentioned, blood work performed today in clinic shows a return to normal of her liver enzymes. I have also sent off serology for the autoimmune joint workup. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Beata Pedda is a pleasant 57-year-old post-COVID survivor who has done well after tapering off of her Symbicort. I have asked her to continue on using it really as needed going forward, and hopefully she will not need it at all in the spring and summertime. I have not made any arrangements for follow-up in our Post-COVID Clinic, but would be happy to see her in my Respirology Clinic if the need arises from a pulmonary point of view. For what it is worth, I have sent off an autoimmune workup for these joint issues. I have asked her to follow up with my colleague, Dr. Hewson, to see if this maybe related to reactive arthritis post-viral infection. I copied Carly on this set of blood work from a serology point of view. Thanks for involving me in her care. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

"RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J928912 cc: Ali A. Bateman Rasha Abdul-Karim Christopher J. Licskai, MD, FRCPC DATE OF CLINIC: August 26, 2022 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Colleagues: Today, I saw Darlene Teslia along with her partner, Jennifer. She was here in COVID Clinic followup for her ongoing management of cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. She is following Dr. Bateman for her headaches as well as for her mobility and exercise. ACTIVE MEDICATIONS: 1. Lyrica 75 mg b.i.d. 2. Hydrocodone syrup every evenings. 3. Symbicort 200/6 two puffs b.i.d. 4. Tylenol Arthritis. 5. Lorazepam. 6. Zopiclone. 7. Budesonide nasal spray. 8. Rabeprazole. 9. Spiriva Respimat. 10. Ventolin p.r.n. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Darlene in the COVID Clinic, she has made some gains with her overall energy and fatigue levels. She has found that Dr. Bateman's suggestions have been quite helpful, which is great to hear. From a pulmonary perspective, she is having significant symptoms of reflux. I wonder if this is actually driving a lot of her cough symptoms. She is also describing some oropharynx sensitivity and almost like an ongoing tickle in the back of her throat. I am not sure if it is related to postnasal drip, reflux or her lungs completely. She does describe significant reflux symptoms with certain foods, especially like chocolate. She does occasionally eat later in the evenings as well. She is taking her PPI at night. I suggested trying to take it in the morning on an empty stomach to see if we can get more benefit from this. She describes her symptoms of coughing really worse at night, which again I wonder if it is related to the reflux component. She had a recent course of prednisone for what sounds like a flare. She does feel like the Symbicort has been helpful over the summer months, especially in this hot humid weather. She has had previous spirometry that is unremarkable for any FEV1 decline, which is reassuring; however, I am not completely sure that her lungs are the primary cause of her cough versus reflux or postnasal drip. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Darlene looked well, in no distress. She was saturating 98 on room air with blood pressure 108/79 and heart rate of 68 beats per minute. INVESTIGATIONS: Blood work drawn today shows a mild peripheral eosinophilia of 0.3 as well as IgE at 76 and a CRP of 15.9. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Darlene Teslia is a 67-year-old lady who has a chronic cough post-COVID that is worse at night. I do wonder if some of it is related to her ongoing reflux. Therefore, I have asked her to switch over to the morning PPI on an empty stomach to see if that helps. The other thought could be a neurogenic cough as she is on appropriate therapy, especially if we bump up her PPI to b.i.d. I wonder if gabapentin could be an option, especially with her other chronic features and I will reach out to Dr. Bateman to see if this is something that we could transfer over to from a Physiatry point of view. I will reach out to his office. I have refilled her hydrocodone just for a few weeks for her cough until her family doctor is returning to the office. From a followup point of view, she is taking off to the US until early March and therefore, we will make a followup when she returns. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

"RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J916978 cc: Marius C. Naghiu, MD Erin Spicer Kristin K. Clemens, MD DATE OF CLINIC: December 3, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-PUL Dear Colleagues: Today, I had the pleasure of seeing John Branzea in COVID Clinic for followup. This is on a background of him having a COVID infection and being admitted to hospital at the end of September. Unfortunately, he is still suffering from post-COVID sequelae of shortness of breath and fatigue. This is on the background of him also unfortunately having lower limb edema, with recently being worked up by a cardiologist in the community. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with John in the clinic, specifically by my colleague, Dr. Spicer, he has had a round the tests that have been quite impressive. He underwent a CT scan that was in the middle of November that showed ongoing ground glass opacities in the peripheral regions but quite impressive. They were still evident after having had a chest CT at the end of October. Of course, this is well past his acute infection that occurred really in the tail end of September. This is on the background of him unfortunately having multiple other comorbidities that are not helping his overall progress. John was quite sick in hospital requiring high-flow supplementation via AIRVO. He is describing ongoing significant shortness of breath that is not evident at rest, but definitely on minimal exertion. He also has had bilateral pleural effusions that are being assessed for possible heart failure. This is in addition to him having some dizzy spells as well as a lack of appetite. Unfortunately, John is really not doing well post-COVID and this is unfortunately what we see in a non-vaccinated individual. With that being said, I had a good conversation and that hopefully convinced him to go get his first dose of vaccine today or tomorrow. We had a good discussion about my concern of him getting a repeat infection, especially as the new variant starts to make its way around the globe. I said to John that he does not have the reserve right now to deal with a COVID infection again, but specifically I am not convinced that his current immune response would be able to tolerate a different variant with its mutations. He had some good questions that I hopefully answered to help ease some of his concerns and actually also suggested that his wife get the vaccine as well. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: John looked well, in no distress. His vital signs did show an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air, but he was a bit hypertensive at 161/94. His heart rate was 98. Respiratory exam did reveal some scattered crackles throughout the lung fields bilaterally. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function tests performed today does show an intraparenchymal restriction. His TLC was 61 with a DLCO of 50. Spirometry shows an elevated ratio with a reduced FVC at 65% predicted or 2.49 litres. As mentioned, CT scan at the middle of November shows persistent postinflammatory scarring in both lobes, throughout all lobes. There is no CT evidence for PE. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: John Branzea is a pleasant 74-year-old gentleman who I think is developing post-COVID ILD, currently. He is not hypoxic yet, but my concern is if we leave him too much longer, he might develop that. I did have a good chat today with John about the risks and benefits of doing nothing and reassessing versus starting him on some therapy. We came to the agreement that it would be best served for him to start a short course of steroids after he gets his first vaccine. I have implored him to go get that today or tomorrow and hopefully start on the prednisone course 10 days after that. He seemed amenable to the plan. I have set him up to start on 40 mg of prednisone 10 days after he gets his first dose of vaccine. I would then reassess him with a CT scan in early January as well as repeat pulmonary function tests. He was amenable to this. I have asked him to call our office if anything worsens in the interim.

This is on the background of her having a COVID infection at the end of August. Unfortunately, Angela is still suffering from post-COVID sequelae of headaches, brain fog, fatigue and word-finding difficulties. Thankfully, she is now fully vaccinated, but at the time of her COVID infection, had only a partial vaccination. We last assessed her in the LUC3 Clinic in the middle of September. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Angela, unfortunately she has persisted to have ongoing fatigue which was thought to be potentially shortness of breath. Unfortunately, this is likely not the case in that it is likely related to her post-COVID cognitive dysfunction. She has ongoing headaches that are definitely worse than her baseline. She has almost daily headaches that almost sound like migraine. She has some occasional intermittent photophobia associated with that. She used to suffer from very mild headaches anywhere between 2 to 4 times in a month, that was usually around her menses. Otherwise, she has never had these significant debilitating headaches or migraine symptoms. She describes it starting at the back of her head associated with a reduced level of smell. She has no hearing loss or phonophobia, but does have photophobia. She is also associated having associated word-finding difficulty and some brain fog. From a cardiopulmonary perspective, she really has no concerns for any issues. She has had no palpitations, presyncopal episodes or chest discomfort. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Angela looked well, in no distress. Vital signs were completely stable, saturating 99% on room air and had a normal blood pressure 110/69, heart rate 95 beats per minute. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function test performed today shows normal ratio, spirometry, static lung volumes and diffusion capacity. Overall, normal pulmonary function testing. Chest x-ray shows normal lung parenchyma and pleural spaces. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Angela McManus is a pleasant unfortunate 43-year-old lady who has post-COVID sequelae of cognitive dysfunction. I have asked her to continue on taking her as-needed medications for her headaches. I believe this is likely post-COVID cognitive dysfunction similar to post-concussion issues or traumatic brain injury patients. She understood this and is gladly accepting referral to our excellent colleagues over at the Parkwood Institute to help her along through this. I have not made any arrangements for her in the COVID Clinic at St. Joe's here, but would be happy to see her again if the need arises. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

Muia Lise Bondy, MD DATE OF CLINIC: December 3, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Colleagues: Today, I had the pleasure of seeing John Sturgeon in Respirology COVID Clinic followup visit. This is on the background of John having a COVID infection in the middle of the spring, is still suffering from chronic symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath. We last saw him in LUC3 clinic virtually at the beginning of November. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with John, he has continued to use his inhaler a little bit less often than I would like. He still has symptoms of shortness of breath on exertion and is still finding himself fatigued. He is not completely back to his baseline still, despite being now many months out. He was discharged home on home oxygen temporarily and thankfully has resolved from that. We had a good chat about his pulmonary function tests being essentially normal today, but that mild asthma can still be underneath normal testing. He was amenable to continuing to trial inhaler therapy going forward, especially after listening to his lungs and potentially appreciating more of an expiratory whistle in his lower lung fields. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: John looked well, in no distress. His vital signs were stable, saturating 97% on room air. Blood pressure is 140/86, heart rate 55 beats per minute. Respiratory exam did reveal some end expiratory whistles in his left mid to lower lung zone and the right lower lung zone. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function tests performed today show a ratio of 83 and an FEV1 of 97% predicted. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: John Sturgeon this is a pleasant 46-year-old gentleman who has what sounds like a reactive airways post-COVID infection bordering on asthma, based on symptoms and his findings today. I asked him to increase his pulmonary medications, including his Zenhale, to more consistent use when he is short of breath. He had essentially stopped it completely and was using it as-needed. I am hoping that this really turns the corner for him going forward from a respiratory point of view, as well as a symptom point of view. We will see him back in two months' time or sooner if the need arises. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

"RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J1544119 cc: Aysha Kharal Dana Bergman, MN, NP-PHC Michael J. Kovacs, MD FRCPC Emily Jones DATE OF CLINIC: December 3, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Colleagues: Today, I had the pleasure of seeing Jitender Sahdev in Respirology COVID Clinic followup. He was last seen by my colleague Dana Bergman in early part of October 2021. We are following up with him with regards to his chest symptoms. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last spoke with Jitender, he has reduced his Symbicort down to 1 puff twice a day temporarily and has found that to be helpful. I have asked him to continue on with that tapering dose as I believe he is much improved and going in the right direction. He still has some intermittent right chest discomfort on exertion, but it is quite infrequent. He went into a discussion with me about sleep apnea and hypoxemia at night. He does have a home oximeter right now, which I suggested he not utilize especially, in the nighttime, as he should have normal desaturation events to a certain degree. He then showed me what appears to be a Fit Bit or watch sleep pattern device. I suggested that he does not have any obvious features of sleep apnea on that, but it might behove him for going for having a sleep study. He does have risk factors as being male with a BMI of 43.3 and a larger neck circumference. He was amenable to considering this going forward. His only other concern was potentially related to constipation? I am not completely sure if he was describing that or tenesmus. We did go over the VQ scan that Dr. Kovacs also went over with him earlier to suggest that he does not have any obvious lingering PE features which is good to hear. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Jitender looked well, in no distress. Vital signs were completely stable, saturating at 96% on room air. His blood pressure was slightly up at 151/87, heart rate of 70 beats per minute. Respiratory exam was unremarkable. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function test performed today shows an extraparenchymal lung restriction, which is likely secondary to the BMI. He had a diffusion capacity that was above his lung volumes and overcorrected suggesting this was extraparenchymal. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Jitender Sahdev is a pleasant 57-year-old gentleman who has recovered nicely from his COVID infection. His lung function testing has improved from last time. This is reassuring. I have asked him to follow up with his family doctor for consideration of a sleep apnea study, a level 1 sleep study at this hospital, as I believe he would benefit from it. I have asked him to trial off Symbicort completely and hopefully, we will have this resolved without issue. I suggested he try PEG lite or RestoraLAX for his constipation issues, but to follow up with his family doctor if he is having tenesmus. I have not made any arrangements for followup, but will be happy to see him if the pulmonary need arises going forward. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

"RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J9876543 cc: Emily Bachmeier, MD DATE OF CLINIC: March 11, 2022 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Dr. Bachmeier: Today, I had the pleasure of seeing Meghan Longstaffe in Respirology COVID Clinic followup. This is the first time I have met Meghan as she was followed by my colleague Dana Bergman before this. Unfortunately, Meghan has been dealing with post-COVID sequelae now for coming up on greater than 18 months, which is unfortunate. She has typical symptoms of POTS as well as the cognitive dysfunction. She is just starting to hear back from our Parkwood colleagues for her support. There is also some concern about some underlying asthma. CURRENT ISSUES: Meghan was started on ivabradine from Dana and has tolerated it well. She feels like this has helped some of her tachycardia. She is having only a few symptoms throughout the day versus having them multiple times per day. She is starting to have a little bit more energy and a little bit more exertional capacity to actually continue on from day-to-day functioning. She is also finding that this has helped some of her cognition and processing as it has slowly improved as well. Her sleep pattern is okay, but she still has some occasional headaches. From a breathing perspective, she tried the Symbicort and switched over to the Breo without much success in regards to her hoarseness and voice changes. She suggested that this would be something not super bothersome for her, but it is something of course, that if she were to not have it would be more beneficial. I did discuss that she might have some issues where if this is a dry powder irritating her vocal cord this could be the cause. She was interested in trying something like Zenhale that is an aerosol generating inhaler versus the other dry powder. We went over some of the other medications that Dana had started like the famotidine. I understand that antihistamines are part of the therapy, but the famotidine I have typically used for more GI symptoms. She has not had much in the way of GI symptoms and therefore feel like she could complete her course and not return on it. The other thing that she was started on because of POTS is a higher salt diet. Of course, she comes in with some hypertension today but believe this is more white coat hypertension more than anything else. Of course, I have asked her to try and cut down on the salt therapy to see if this helps and if her POTS symptoms recur to go back on the salt therapy. Overall, we had a good chat today also about the unfortunate longevity of some of these symptoms. I think having some appropriate Parkwood supporting therapy is going to help Meghan and of course unfortunately also time. The next step will be what we need to do with the ivabradine if we need to taper it off once she starts to get even more settled with the POTS. This is still a new entity for many physicians let alone post-COVID. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Meghan looked well, in no distress. Heart rate was 63 beats per minute with a blood pressure 146/89, saturating 98% on room air. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Meghan Longstaffe is a pleasant 37-year-old post-COVID survivor still suffering from some POTS as well as cognitive dysfunction. I asked her to stick with us through the Parkwood program and she was amenable to this. I also refilled her ivabradine for her POTS and we will see how that goes in the next few months. From a hoarseness and an asthmatic therapy point of view, I have asked her to consider switching over to Zenhale if she is finding the hoarseness or throat irritation being too much. She was amenable to this. We will see her back in a few months in the post-COVID Clinic. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

"RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J930841 cc: Mary R. Ellaway DATE OF CLINIC: February 2, 2023 PATIENT LOCATION: J-RespCl Dear Dr. Ellaway: Today, I had the pleasure of speaking with Walid Sabahi in Respirology Clinic followup for his post-COVID issues and contributions of likely reactive airways disease or asthma. He is currently on Symbicort therapy and stepped it up to 4 times a day appropriately. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since I last saw Walid, he had undergone a cardiopulmonary exercise test and a bubble echo study. Interestingly, the bubble echo was concerning for some late bubbling, but likely is related to physiological shunting and not a pathological shunt. The reason this is likely after I spoke with Dr. Thain who read the echo, he reported that was likely minimal and very late stage, which can occur in normal physiology. Additionally, he underwent the CPET and that demonstrated no desaturation events at rest or on exertion. This essentially rules out a shunt, as normally if there is true physiological shunting, there should be a reduction in SpO2 levels both at rest and especially on exertion. He does feel like he gets improvement and relief with higher doses of his Symbicort. He is not on an additional inhaler as of yet, which is a reasonable next step. Interestingly, he does have a decent amount of blood work that shows peripheral eosinophilia and an elevated IgE level. I do wonder if there is ongoing concerning inflammatory markers for this the reason. We had a good chat today about potential options for therapies and one does include oral prednisone. He does not recall having that for a decent amount of time if at all. I therefore thought it would be reasonable to trial this. Of course, I used caveat that it can increase his overall exertional energy levels artificially, but he was willing to try it without having any concerning risks. This was a good discussion point, I am glad that we had this. INVESTIGATIONS: As previously mentioned, echocardiogram performed via bubble study was demonstrating very late bubbling which is likely physiological. It is not pathological. The reason for this that he had a CPET test thereafter and did not demonstrate any desaturation events. He is actually limited by his capacity of coughing that can be seen in asthma or reactive airways. As mentioned earlier, IgE level has been elevated at 668 and steadily increasing since 2021 with his peripheral eosinophil count also at 0.4, 0.3 throughout the year. On the CPET assessment, he did have an elevated heart rate during the exercise component. It was exaggerated heart rate response well above what it should have been for the stage of investigations, therefore potentially suggesting POTS. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Walid Sabahi is a 56-year-old gentleman who has an exaggerated heart rate elevation with his CPET test that likely is in keeping with POTS. I will see if I can arrange for a tilt table test for him. He was amenable to this. I have given him a short course of prednisone 50 mg daily to see if this helps his breathlessness, coughing and exertional capacity. This is all, of course, on the context of him having potentially an increase in energy from steroids. I will speak with him shortly after initiating that and I discussed either tapering off or a complete stoppage of 50 of prednisone. I would like to see him back with a repeat breathing tests and some blood work in the spring time. I will also see if I can arrange for a tilt table test in the interim. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

"RESPIROLOGY CONSULTATION ( Auth (Verified) ) J893062 cc: Michael A. Mitchell, MD Paula Suffoletta, MD DATE OF CONSULTATION: December 17, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Mike: Thanks for the kind referral of Judy Garner a very pleasant, but unfortunate 55-year-old lady who was referred to the Post-COVID Clinic for post-COVID sequelae of what sounds like breathlessness and fatigue. I saw her today in consultation in our Post-COVID Clinic. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Alpha-1 antitrypsin disease. 2. Reflux. 3. COVID infection the end of 2020 into early 2021. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Multivitamin. 2. Pantoprazole 40 mg p.r.n. 3. Vitamin B12. 4. (?) Symbicort p.r.n. ALLERGIES: No known drug or environmental allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a PSW and housekeeper at Middlesex Terrace Nursing Home in Delaware, Ontario. She is a lifelong nonsmoker and has no concerning illicit drug use. COVID HISTORY: Unfortunately, Judy describes getting vaccinated on December 27, 2020 and a few days thereafter started to notice significant symptoms of COVID infection. At first, she thought she was having side effects of the vaccine, but unfortunately really started to appreciate, due to the outbreak at her nursing home, that she was having COVID infection. Acutely, she felt quite short of breath with chest tightness and chest discomfort. She was also quite presyncopal and described having palpitations. Interestingly, though she did not ever describe having a significant cough, dry or productive. Thankfully, she was never admitted, but did struggle with this set of symptoms. She was given a Symbicort inhaler she believes that she found somewhat beneficial throughout it. Skipping forward to her post-COVID sequelae. Unfortunately, she was off work until May of this year, really struggling with fatigue and what sounds like shortness of breath. She is also really describing a lot of joint symptoms, which are concerning. She had previous history of sciatica, but never anything with respect to chronic joint discomfort. I wonder if this is more of a reactive arthritis that she is dealing with. She gets very little benefit from mobilizing around and had some joint pain thereafter. She has also found that she has had some palpitations and presyncopal symptoms that are intermittent and potentially also related to some of her shortness of breath. She has had a fantastic workup by her family doctor including an echocardiogram and a Holter that really, unfortunately, did not demonstrate much in the way of abnormalities. She has had some possible issues with asthma, but no real nocturnal symptoms that are concerning. The only other thing that I noticed in her history is that she really is having symptoms and describing symptoms while at work. Part of me wonders if this is rooted in her acquiring the infection and being so sick while working at the nursing home. I wonder if this is some of the posttraumatic stress that she is finding, especially when placing the mask on and all the other PPE. I asked her if this is something she had thought about and she somewhat agree that this could be related. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Judy looked well, in no distress. She was saturating 98% on room air and other vital signs were completely stable. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Judy Garner is a very pleasant 55-year-old lady who has a normal-appearing x-ray and is almost 12 months post-COVID infection. She is still suffering from significant symptoms that I am not completely sure fit into a nice category. For what it is worth, I have given her some trial samples of Symbicort to see if this helps with some of her shortness of breath symptoms that she is describing. I have also reached out to our Social Worker in the Post-COVID Clinic to see if she can get some benefit with some potential mental health support and guidance for her concerns at work. I will see her back after the new year has begun and follow up with her with respect to her inhaler therapy and any other supports that she might have been able to gain from our Allied Health members. The next step would be to include her into our COVID Rehab Program if this is something that is really the crux of her ongoing issues. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

"RESPIROLOGY CONSULTATION ( Modified ) J694884 cc: Gordon B. Schacter, MD, CCFP DATE OF CONSULTATION: December 17, 2021 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Gord: Thanks for the kind referral of Julia, a very pleasant 46-year-old lady who was referred to the Post-COVID Clinic for further followup of her COVID sequelae. Unfortunately, she is still suffering from post-COVID fatigue and possible shortness of breath since her COVID infection back in May of 2020. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: Post-COVID sequelae. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Escitalopram 10 mg at bedtime. 2. Ventolin p.r.n. SOCIAL HISTORY: Julia is a 46-year-old lady who is a housekeeper PSW at a long-term care facility. She is a lifelong nonsmoker and does not consume any recreational drugs. She is married with children. COVID HISTORY: Unfortunately, Julia was infected with COVID at the end of April and transitioned into May symptoms. She was utilizing Symbicort post-COVID and thought that it might help initially. She was able to wean off of it and was subsequently discharged from the COVID Clinic. She unfortunately still had ongoing issues of post-COVID fatigue that really continued to overwhelm her and have caused her to return to work with only 2 hours at work at a time. She is flat out exhausted after doing this. I have asked her if she has any other symptoms of asthma or chest symptoms. She really does not endorse anything. She has recently been initiated on a physiotherapy regimen at an outside institution, but is finding that difficult to do as well because she is exhausted. She does not have an OT referral. This is part of the reason she is here in clinic today to send her into our program so that we can enact some supports going forward for her. She was quite amenable to this and looking forward to this. The other major concern that Julia did open up about was significant low mood post-COVID. It also sounds like there might be some posttraumatic issues with work as well in that she has never had a mental health concern before this. She was started on escitalopram more recently. She is willing to continue to discuss this, and I will make a referral to a psychologist that is associated with our clinic that has been instrumental in helping people with their mental health. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Julie looked well, in no distress. Vital signs were completely stable, saturating 96% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function tests performed today are completely normal. She has normal lung volumes, diffusing capacity and spirometry. This was reassuring to her. Chest x-ray performed prior to clinic shows a prominent left hilum. This was seen back in August of 2020. It was also seen again in May of 2020. Nevertheless, the reporting radiologist suggests this should be followed up with a CT scan. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Julia Mavin is a pleasant 46-year-old post-COVID survivor who is still suffering from post-COVID sequelae. I feel awful for her and want to help her along the lines of following up with us in our Allied Health Clinic. She was amenable to having a referral to our OT as well as psychologist. If our Allied Health members suggest she could continue to gain benefit from other Allied Health members in our Post-COVID Clinic, such as our PT, I will happily make arrangements for that to happen. I will make arrangements for the CT scan to be done to reassess the left hilum, although low clinical suspicion due to it being still prominent in x-rays in May 2020. I will followup with her over the phone to chat about her CT scan. I have made arrangements for her to follow up with our Allied Health members thereafter. Thanks for involving me in her care.

"RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J642633 cc: Izuagbe Eseosa Osayi David G. McCormack, MD FRCPC Dana Bergman, MN, NP-PHC DATE OF CLINIC: February 18, 2022 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Colleagues: Today, I had the pleasure of seeing Karen Bernard in the Respirology COVID Clinic followup. This is on the background of Karen being admitted for a short period in April for her COVID infection. She is still suffering from post-COVID sequelae. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we last saw Karen, she has gradually improved over time, which is very encouraging to see. Her smell and taste have improved and this is a large positive. She has been involved in a Parkwood Rehab Program and has found that quite helpful as well. She informs me that she is safely retired, which is great to see as well. She is still suffering from some indigestion and heartburn, but is much improved after going back on the Prevacid. I thought it was very reasonable to try taking her off it as my colleague did, but clearly her body is more in tune with Prevacid management. I suggested she can go up to twice a day or even adding something like famotidine, if things worsen. She is understanding and will consider that in the future. Her fatigue is probably the most significant side effect she is still suffering from. Unfortunately, I think it is multifactorial, not just from the pandemic, but from her poor sleep hygiene. I think this is also playing a role from the COVID infection with the sleep disruption and pattern of obstruction. There has been some literature surrounding this. She thankfully does not have any headaches, but unfortunately is still suffering from issues for sleep. Therefore, had a good discussion with her about taking some over-the-counter melatonin to start. Alternatively, other options are available and also working her up for a sleep study could be a possibility. Truthfully Karen was not interested in a lot of other medications, which I can understand and appreciate, but I did suggest we have lots of options for her going forward. Again, sleep hygiene could be something she could continue to work on as well. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Karen looked well, in no distress. Her vital signs were completely stable, saturating 98 on room air. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Karen Bernard is a pleasant 71-year-old COVID survivor who really has very minimal respiratory symptoms that are remaining and her biggest concern is fatigue and it is likely multifactorial from post-COVID as well as sleep pattern and hygiene. I have asked her to initiate on melatonin supplemental therapy. I have not made any arrangements for followup, but we would be happy to see her again if the need arises. I am also happy to refer her to a sleep physician if she feels like her sleep is still an issue and we can have further assessment from one of my colleagues. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

"RESPIROLOGY CLINIC ( Auth (Verified) ) J1541507 cc: Bradley T. Bobby DATE OF CLINIC: February 18, 2022 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Dr. Bobby: Today, I saw Sarah Sabourin a in Respirology Clinic followup for her post-COVID sequelae, as well as low diffusing capacity, NYD. This is on the background of us last seeing her in the clinic here in the end of October. She underwent echocardiogram and a VQ scan to rule out any pulmonary hypertension or PE sequelae. Thankfully, she had none of the above. INTERVAL HISTORY: Sarah is continuously on inhaler therapy of fluticasone and is tolerating that well. She feels like she is gradually improving over time and this is good to see. She is involved in our Parkwood COVID rehabilitation program, which I think is the most beneficial for most post-COVID patients, specifically for Sarah. She is feeling like it is benefiting her, which is great to see. She has no respiratory symptoms outside of some exertional dyspnea intermittently, denying any chest tightness, pain or shortness of breath at rest. She has had some improvement in her cognition and concentration. This is great to see, but her fatigue is still an issue. I know she is working through that with the post-COVID rehabilitation program. She has received 2 vaccines and I have encouraged her to get her third, but know she wants to take some time for this. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Sarah looked well, in no distress. Vital signs were completely stable, saturating 95 to 98% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function test performed today reveals still an isolated low diffusion capacity. It is essentially unchanged from previous. Flow volume loop is normal. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Sarah Sabourin is a pleasant 24-year-old patient who is slowly recovering from her post-COVID sequelae. She is going through the post-COVID Rehab program at Parkwood, which is great to see. I have asked her to continue on with that and I will finalize our workup for isolated low diffusing capacity, with a low dose CT chest. She was amenable to this. I have also done some blood work today to ensure she does not have a low hemoglobin as well as some other investigations for fatigue including a TSH and ferritin. I will call her back with results of the CT scan and go from there. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

This is on the background of her having her infection in November 2021. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: 1. COVID infection, not requiring hospitalization November 2021. Has had previous vaccines x2 prior to infection. 2. Raynaud's phenomenon, NYD. 3. Previous decompression surgery with discectomy in 2017 secondary to massive disc herniation and cauda equina syndrome. 4. Previous Horner syndrome, NYD. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Advil p.r.n. SOCIAL HISTORY: Is a lifelong nonsmoker. She currently works as an ECE, but has been on the substitute list. She has not worked in over a year. She lives independently with her ADLs and IADLs. FAMILY HISTORY: Strong family history of asthma in her son. There is also concerning features of autoimmune disease. RESPIRATORY HISTORY: Unfortunately, Tara really describes having ongoing symptomatology despite having double vaccine status and having COVID in November. She describes a chest burning and discomfort in the center of her chest, especially with some issues of dyspnea and chest tightness. She has not tried any inhalers and although is understanding of them based on her son's history, she has not had any herself. She does have some occasional issues with cough, but it is intermittent and rare at best. The other major concern she has had post-COVID is really a worsening of her chronic neurological issues and pain that she had prior to COVID. Since having COVID she has had a worsening of the majority of her symptoms. This does include symptoms in her hip and occasionally radiating to her groin. She does have some back issues as well. Thankfully, she has not had any major features of thromboembolic disease, denying any calf swelling or erythema. She has had some myalgias that have occurred as well that have been intermittent and fluctuating. I am not completely sure if this is related to reactive arthritis or her underlying possible autoimmune disorder. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Tara looked well, in no distress. Her vital signs were completely stable, saturating 96% on room air. Respiratory exam was clear with good breath sounds heard throughout the lung fields bilaterally. She was a bit tachycardic at 102 beats per minute but otherwise looked stable. INVESTIGATIONS: Chest x-ray performed prior to clinic does show some coarsening bronchovascular markings to then consider bronchitis or active inflammation. Full pulmonary function test performed today shows a normal spirometry with an FEV1 preserved at 92% predicted or 3.27 litres. Her small airways showed some mild obstruction. Lung volumes were normal at 104% for TLC and diffusion capacity is normal at 92%. Overall, grossly normal pulmonary function testing. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Tara McInnis is a pleasant 36-year-old COVID survivor who is still suffering from some post-COVID sequelae, especially with respect to her chest and chronic pain issues. I have asked her to initiate on some Symbicort inhaler therapy due to the small airways that might be affected and some of her clinical symptoms. I suggested that she could have something like reactive airways disease, especially with the risk factor of family history of asthma. I have done some extensive blood work today to reassess some of her autoimmune issues as well as to rule out any other inflammatory markers that might be elevated. I will make a referral to a Rheumatology colleague, to hopefully follow up with Tara from an arthritis and inflammation point of view. I will see her Tara back in 3 months' time to see how her breathing is doing on the Symbicort. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

Unfortunately, she had contracted COVID in the early part of November 2021 and is dealing with significant sequelae since. She remains unvaccinated. Maria is accompanied by a Spanish translator today from MCIS. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Query asthma. 2. Arthritis. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Advair 250/25 mcg 1 puff b.i.d. 2. Voltaren gel p.r.n. 3. Naproxen p.r.n. ALLERGIES: No known drug or environmental allergies. FAMILY HISTORY: There is a strong family history of asthma in her family as well. SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a nonsmoker. She does not have any obvious pet exposures. She is a homemaker. COVID HISTORY: Maria obtained COVID the end of October or early November 2021. She became symptomatic when she was acutely unwell, but otherwise was not hospitalized. Unfortunately, her biggest symptoms then likely still exist now. She initially had a sore throat, headache, and was fatigued significantly. Currently, she is still describing fatigue and a headache. Her largest issue today is really the cough though, especially when she is exerting herself or talking a lot. She is also describing asthmatic features of the cough where it is nocturnal. It is not productive and is not associated with any shortness of breath or chest tightness. She denies any postnasal drip or reflux symptoms. I asked her about the Advair that she has prescribed and she felt like it helps. I asked her why she did not want to continue to use it and unfortunately she did not really provide a great answer other than she did not want be stuck on a medication. I then insisted that she utilize the inhaler if it is going to help her, especially with her asthma history and the sequelae we have seen post-COVID of worsening asthma symptoms. I suggested that despite having normal PFTs today, she could still have an asthmatic cough. This is especially true if she found that the inhaler, Advair, did help. I did not bother going into any application for obtaining double vaccines today as Maria suggested that she remained unvaccinated for a reason when I first introduced myself and asked about her vaccine status. PHYSICAL EXAM: Maria looked stable, in no distress. Her vital signs were completely stable, saturating 98% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Full pulmonary function tests performed today shows a ratio of 81 and an FEV1 of 98% predicted or 2.77 litres. TLC and diffusing capacity were both normal as well at 103% and 94% respectively. Blood work performed at the end of clinic today shows a mild CRP and a low ferritin. Otherwise, there is no peripheral eosinophilia. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Maria Rodriguez Jaramillo is a 39-year-old post-COVID survivor who is suffering from symptoms of cough, fatigue, and headaches intermittently. I have asked her to continue on with her Advair inhaler consistently 1 puff twice a day. She was amenable to starting this back up. I will see her back in 3 months' time to reassess how she is doing on consistent inhaler therapy. I did advise her that over time, her symptoms might improve and that we can then discuss weaning off the inhaler thereafter. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

Unfortunately, she had contracted COVID in the early part of November 2021 and is dealing with significant sequelae since. She remains unvaccinated. Maria is accompanied by a Spanish translator today from MCIS. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Query asthma. 2. Arthritis. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Advair 250/25 mcg 1 puff b.i.d. 2. Voltaren gel p.r.n. 3. Naproxen p.r.n. ALLERGIES: No known drug or environmental allergies. FAMILY HISTORY: There is a strong family history of asthma in her family as well. SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a nonsmoker. She does not have any obvious pet exposures. She is a homemaker. COVID HISTORY: Maria obtained COVID the end of October or early November 2021. She became symptomatic when she was acutely unwell, but otherwise was not hospitalized. Unfortunately, her biggest symptoms then likely still exist now. She initially had a sore throat, headache, and was fatigued significantly. Currently, she is still describing fatigue and a headache. Her largest issue today is really the cough though, especially when she is exerting herself or talking a lot. She is also describing asthmatic features of the cough where it is nocturnal. It is not productive and is not associated with any shortness of breath or chest tightness. She denies any postnasal drip or reflux symptoms. I asked her about the Advair that she has prescribed and she felt like it helps. I asked her why she did not want to continue to use it and unfortunately she did not really provide a great answer other than she did not want be stuck on a medication. I then insisted that she utilize the inhaler if it is going to help her, especially with her asthma history and the sequelae we have seen post-COVID of worsening asthma symptoms. I suggested that despite having normal PFTs today, she could still have an asthmatic cough. This is especially true if she found that the inhaler, Advair, did help. I did not bother going into any application for obtaining double vaccines today as Maria suggested that she remained unvaccinated for a reason when I first introduced myself and asked about her vaccine status. PHYSICAL EXAM: Maria looked stable, in no distress. Her vital signs were completely stable, saturating 98% on room air. INVESTIGATIONS: Full pulmonary function tests performed today shows a ratio of 81 and an FEV1 of 98% predicted or 2.77 litres. TLC and diffusing capacity were both normal as well at 103% and 94% respectively. Blood work performed at the end of clinic today shows a mild CRP and a low ferritin. Otherwise, there is no peripheral eosinophilia. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Maria Rodriguez Jaramillo is a 39-year-old post-COVID survivor who is suffering from symptoms of cough, fatigue, and headaches intermittently. I have asked her to continue on with her Advair inhaler consistently 1 puff twice a day. She was amenable to starting this back up. I will see her back in 3 months' time to reassess how she is doing on consistent inhaler therapy. I did advise her that over time, her symptoms might improve and that we can then discuss weaning off the inhaler thereafter. Yours sincerely, Michael J.

No cough present Cardiovascular: s1/s2 normal with no additional heart sounds appreciated. Pulse strong and regular on palpation. ACTIVE ISSUES DISCUSSED TODAY: Today I met with Alexa, for the assessment of Post-COVID Condition (PCC). We discussed their journey and symptom timeline. Unfortunately, Alexa is uncertain of their exact COVID history. They state that they had COVID in ""2020, 2021, and January, 2022"" which were confirmed by rapid antigen testing (RAT). However, RAT tests were not available until fall, 2021 and their only PCR completed in 2020 was negative, therefore, I am uncertain this infection was confirmed. Regarding their infection in 2021, they were unable to provide an approximate timeline [The following PCR testing from OLIS include (PCR results can remain positive for up to 3 months from time of COVID-19 infection): July 14th, 2020 (-ve); August 28th, 2021 (-ve); November 15th, 2021 (-ve); and December 29th, 2021 (-ve). In 2022 Alexa states both them and their partner did test positive by RAT test on January 3rd, 2022. Moreover, there is an Emergency Department (ED) encounter dated May 14th, 2022 for 'hemoptysis (Covid +)'. I asked Alexa to clarify about an infection in May, 2022, but they stated ""I don't remember; maybe I didn't have COVID in 2020 - I must have had Covid in 2021, and January and May, 2022"". Regarding their acute symptoms, Alexa states in January, 2022 they had new onset hemoptysis and runny nose, which lasted approximately one week. In May, 2022, their hemoptysis recurred for which Alexa had a CXR completed on May 13th, 2022 and was normal. However, their symptoms continued to worsen, therefore, Ms. MacInnis presented to the University Hospital ED the evening of May 14th, 2022, but left before being assessed due to the long wait, they then presented to St. Thomas General Elgin ED late afternoon on May 15th, 2022 due to continued hemoptysis, but it does not appear any imaging or labs were completed; they were discharged home after approximately 2.5 hours. Ms. MacInnis states the hemoptysis once again resolved after approximately one week, and they felt more or less back to baseline, however, that same month, they sustained a concussion, which was the result of standing up and hitting their head on a shelf - Alexa did not present to the ED. They deny any associated nausea, vomiting, photophobia, amnesia, or loss of consciousness after the injury. ""Months later"", Alexa began to experience cold sweats, cold intolerance, and mild brain fog. Unfortunately, they sustained a subsequent concussion in November, 2023, secondary to ""sneezing dramatically, and hit their head"". Alexa once again denied the presence of any red flag symptoms and did not present to the ED, but was assessed by their PCP and referred to Preferred Rehab Physiotherapy for concussion rehab. However, Ms. MacInnis did recently present to the ED in March, 2024, due to headaches and photophobia. They were assessed to have post-concussion headache and occipital neuralgia type-pain and discharged back to the care of their concussion rehab team, whom has been treating Alexa for the past 7 weeks. Regarding their employment history, Alexa states they have been unemployed until beginning work as a TA in 2023 as part of their Master's of Sociology program. Ms. MacInnis stopped working in September, 2023 due to their symptoms, and have since deferred their schooling. Presently, Alexa states their foremost concerns are ""fatigue, post exertional malaise, POTS/racing heart, shortness of breath, and brain fog"". They state symptoms first presented in August, 2023, ""but I am sure they began even earlier around August, 2022, I just wasn't aware"". Regarding their palpitations, Alexa stating ""I do not experience palpitations; I do not feel fluttering in my chest. I would describe it as becoming lightheaded and my heart starts racing"". I inquired about triggers, which Alexa said ""when I am standing"", and their symptoms will last for approximately 1-2 hours even after sitting. Alexa denies any loss of consciousness, slips, trips, or falls during these events. They believe based on their own research, ""I have POTS"". I reviewed with Alexa the results of their modified stand test today, which does raise suspicious for dysautonomia/POTS, as there was a supine to standing heart rate increase of 56 bpm, while blood pressure remained stable and Alexa was symptomatic with dizziness. As such, I offered a referral to Dr. Guzman in Hamilton, who is a dysautonomia specialist and could confirm a diagnosis. Ms. MacInnis was agreeable o this. We also reviewed the results of their Holter monitor, which was essentially normal with no evidence of significant arrhythmias (no diary returned), as well as reviewed with them their PFTs, which were completely normal. Lastly, Alexa further inquired if IBS is a symptom of Long-Covid, as based on their research they feel they have IBS, due to fluctuating episodes of constipation and diarrhea, triggered by emotions and stress. They since started on a daily probiotic, but have noticed no effect - I have suggested a trial of over the counter Metamucil, as directed on the package for possible IBS-M. Ms. MacInnis was amenable to this. Overall, I shared with Alexa and their mother that currently Long-COVID is a diagnosis that can only be made by the exclusion of other underlying aetiologies, as well as based on clinical judgment from a detailed history and symptom timeline in relation to a confirmed COVID-19 infection. I validated Alexa's symptoms, acknowledging their symptoms are real, and are impacting their quality of life. However, although Alexa's symptoms do sound characteristic of PCC, they are also characteristic of symptoms of Post-Concussion Syndrome. Moreover, since their COVID infection and concussion occurred within the same month, it becomes even more difficult to discern between the two conditions. Interestingly, Alexa's Covid antibody test from today came back positive, indicating they were infected with COVID-19 within the past 12 months - possibly in August, 2023, as this seems to be when Alexa first noticed their symptom onset. However, Ms. MacInnis denies any known URI's between May, 2022 until now, but does have a documented history of Group Strep A in both January, 2023 and December, 2023. A repeat culture was completed in January, 2024 which was negative. Nevertheless, Alexa is currently undergoing treatment for their concussion through Preferred Physiotherapy. I informed Ms. MacInnis that I cannot be certain their symptoms are due to PCC, as there is no diagnostic test available. However, current management of this condition is through supportive care and rehabilitation. Fortunatley, our program does consist of an excellent rehabilitation team whom fortunately, also have a background in traumatic brain injuries/concussions, therefore, I will refer Alexa to the Post-Acute COVID-19 Rehabilitation Program, who can hopefully further delineate between PCC and Post-Concussion Syndrome as the underlying cause of Ms. MacInnis' symptoms. Alexa understood this information, and further inquired about applying for ODSP, with concern of not being given a definitive diagnosis today, stating that they have read cases online of patients in similar situations who were given a diagnosis of ME/CFS to increase their chance of ODSP application approval. I explained to Alexa approval is not solely determined by a patient's underlying condition, rather, it is based off a detailed and accurate history which can demonstrate how a patient's symptoms are impacting their quality of life and ability to work. ASSESSMENT: In summary, Ms. MacInnis is a 24-year-old, who has a stated history of multiple COVID-19 infections (2020, 2021, Jan/May, 2022) and x2 concussions (May, 2022 & November, 2023) who later developed symptoms of brain fog, PEM, and orthostatic intolerance in August, 2023. Due to a conflicting clinical history, overlapping symptomatology's, and no diagnostic testing currently available, it is difficult to discern if Alexa's symptoms are secondary to Post-COVID Condition, or possibly due to another cause, such as Post-Concussion Syndrome, vs ME/CFS. Nevertheless, since management of PCC is supportive care, we will proceed down this pathway, while continuing to rule out other potential causes for Ms. MacInnis' symptoms. PATIENT IDENTIFIED GOALS: Fatigue Post-Exertional Malaise Brain Fog Dyspnea Mood POTS/Orthostatic Intolerance Gastrointestinal Concerns PLAN: Fatigue/PEM/Brain Fog: I have sent a referral to Parkwood Post-Acute COVID-19 Rehabilitation team who can further assess Alexa's symptoms in relation to Post-COVID Condition (PCC) versus Post-Concussive Syndrome. The rehab team also offers a 7-week educational series called COVID-101, which Ms. MacInnis was interested in participating in. Educational handouts on brain fog, PEM, and sleep hygiene were also provided. Dyspnea: PFTs normal. Encouraged to practice deep breathing. This is also a topic that will be addressed during COVID-101 Mood: Based on the score of Alexa's PHQ-4, I discussed with them a referral to Ontario Structured Psychotherapy Program (OSP West), which is a program that offers OHIP funded CBT support, as well as self-directed learning modules. Alexa was amenable to a referral; therefore, one was sent. Ms. MacInnis was also provided with our mental health pamphlet containing various mental health resources within the community and region, along with Reach Out and the new 988 crisis support numbers. POTS/Orthostatic Intolerance: I reassured Alexa the results of their Holter were normal. I will also send a referral to Dr. Guzman in Hamilton, who specializes in dysautonomia/POTS, and could provide a more in-depth assessment and consultation - they are aware of his clinic's location, as well as lengthy waitlist. Alexa has also researched POTS treatment, which includes increased fluids, salt, and compression. I have stated they can trial such conservative treatments, to determine effectiveness. Additionally, as per the prerequisites for referral to Dr. Guzman, I have ordered an echocardiogram which has been scheduled for May 24th, 2024. Ms. MacInnis was agreeable. Nurse Practitioner Kaushal, should conservative measures be unsuccessful after a few months, you may consider trialing a low dose beta blocker, such as 2.5 mg bisoprolol, if there are no formal contraindications. GI Concerns: Query IBS-M - Alexa states their bowels fluctuate between periods of constipation and loose stools, which are exacerbated by stress and emotion. I have recommended they trial over-the-counter Metamucil, as directed. I also encouraged Ms. MacInnis to evaluate discontinuation of daily probiotics, based on cost vs benefit, as although they are not harmful, they are also not necessary. FOLLOW-UP: 3-4 months in person Thank you, Nurse Practitioner Popovic, for referring Ms. MacInnis. It is my pleasure to be involved in Alexa's COVID-19 care. Should you or Nurse Practitioner Kaushal have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our clinic. Sincerely, Mariah Mariah Zalitach, MN NP-PHC Post-Acute COVID-19 Clinic St. Joseph's Health Care London"

Wiebe Mithu Sen, MD, FRCPC Shane Smith Maged Elrayes DATE OF CONSULTATION: April 5, 2024 PATIENT LOCATION: J-B3COVIDCL Dear Dr. Wiebe: Thank you for the kind referral of Mark Eagleson, a pleasant 63-year-old gentleman, who was referred to the Long COVID Clinic for ongoing symptoms of concerning long COVID. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: 1. OSA. 2. Infrarenal AAA. 3. Dyslipidemia. 4. Osteoarthritis. 5. Reflux. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Bezafibrate. 2. Aspirin. 3. Lansoprazole. 4. Percocet p.r.n. 5. Trazodone p.r.n. 6. Multivitamin. 7. Rosuvastatin. ALLERGIES: No known drug or environmental allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: Mark is a significant ex-smoker, quitting in 2013, but smoking almost 2 to 3 packs per day for many years. I would put him mostly at a 50-pack-year smoker. He is working as a transport truck driver, but is currently not working. RESPIRATORY HISTORY: Unfortunately, he describes having his COVID infection in August of 2022. It sounds like it was impressive enough where he had a mild set of symptoms, but a consistent set of symptoms that lasted for many days. He had low energy, fatigue, shortness of breath, fevers, chills and anorexia. We then had a bit of a sinus infection in January of 2023 that really felt like it was more impactful than the COVID that he was swabbed positive for. He states after the August 2022 infection that took him 6 to 8 weeks to really start to feel back to normal. He did get back to work and he was exercising again. It was after the January 2023 sinus infection that he really struggled with a lot of his long COVID symptoms. He has had significant shortness of breath on exertion, fatigue and reduced energy levels. He was noted to have a concern for significant hemoglobin drop in February 2023 with 2 duodenal ulcers found with presumed H. pylori. Despite that evidence and treatment, he has not had an improvement back to normal functionality. He has some nocturnal symptoms that fit with OSA and he is waiting to see with Dr. Sen's opinion is based on the sleep study. He thankfully does not have any true orthopnea or PND, but has more nocturia, and when he wakes up, he is short of breath when he gets up to urinate thereafter. He has not noticed any lower limb swelling and he has not noticed any other concerning features that tie into something atypical at night, such as snoring. This has been an ongoing issue for him though for some years and potentially made worse by his long COVID. Currently, he is describing a lot of fatigue, low energy levels throughout the day as well as shortness of breath on exertion. He is still awaiting an echocardiogram for assessment of some possible pulmonary hypertension, which again would be in the realm of potentially OSA plus the smoking history. We had a good chat about him being assessed by our COVID Rehab program for many reasons, but also does still have _____ followup with Dr. Sen. I think having some workup for his echocardiogram and some blood work to ensure no atypical PH, findings are present would be helpful. This is important as looking for other alternative etiologies of the shortness of breath and fatigue would be important in managing along with his long COVID. He was amenable to this. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Mark looked well, in no distress. He is saturating 96 on room air. Blood pressure was a bit up at 144/93 with a heart rate of _____ beats per minute. He had no lower limb edema and precordial exam was unremarkable. His respiratory exam was unremarkable as well. INVESTIGATIONS: As mentioned earlier, echocardiogram showed some mild pulmonary hypertension back in June of 2023. Pulmonary function test performed pre and post in September 2023 are all completely normal. He has no evidence of asthma or COPD. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mark Eagleson is a 63-year-old gentleman who has long COVID symptoms and also concerning issues for sleep apnea and potentially pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, my plan will be as follows: 1. Long COVID: Sent him into the long COVID rehabilitation program at Parkwood. He was amenable to this. 2. OSA: Followup with Dr. Sen. 3. Query PH: We will repeat an echo and blood work and _____ after that. Michael J.

I am seeing her for her ongoing fatigue and dyspnea. This is on the background of her having a diagnosis of asthma, previously followed by my Allergy colleagues. ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: 1. Asthma. 2. Allergies with allergic rhinitis. 3. Depression. 4. Previous tonsillectomy. MEDICATIONS: 1. Trelegy Ellipta. 2. Cetirizine p.r.n. 3. Mometasone nasal spray. 4. Montelukast. 5. Multivitamin. 6. Vitamin D3. ALLERGIES: 1. Environmental. 2. Mold. 3. Septra. SOCIAL HISTORY: Nichole is employed in the traumatic brain injury area. She is a remote smoker with minimal smoking history. RESPIRATORY HISTORY: Unfortunately, Nichole really talks about having an impressive degree of symptomatology occurred after her exposure to COVID when she was travelling in summer of 2023. She ended up having symptoms when she was travelling to Vancouver with a sore throat and _____ asthma worsening. She ended up appropriately using Symbicort, Ventolin and Atrovent while out there. At that point, she was triple vaccinated with her last vaccine in 2022. She had the requirements appropriately with the patients that she worked with in a traumatic brain injury program. She continued to feel diaphoretic, weak and worse when she was unwell in Vancouver. Unfortunately, the concerns really lingered when she returned home with ongoing fatigue and reduced energy. She also had the symptoms of shortness of breath that did not dissipate. Her long COVID symptoms really are associated with brain fog, fatigue and worsening issues with shortness of breath. She continues to have issues with low mood and low energy as well. We had a good chat about how this is a significant overlap with postconcussion syndrome and I think this is likely where she is going to derive a lot of knowledge and benefits from. We talked about pacing and energy conservation. I think she would be an excellent candidate for rehab program. Unfortunately, I also think she would be a good candidate for a psychiatric assessment, but she scored 7/12 on her PHQ. At this point, I do not have any psychiatric colleagues involved in the program and I think it would be beneficial for her to try that route if things do not improve from a mood perspective. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Nichole looked well, in no distress. She was saturating 99 on room air. Blood pressure and heart rate were normal. Blood pressure was 124/91 with a pulse of 104. INVESTIGATIONS: Pulmonary function test performed in October of last year show completely normal FEV1 and FVC. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Nichole Daly is a 47-year-old lady who is _____ worsening from a perspective of function and fatigue. I think she would be an excellent candidate for rehab program with her long COVID symptomatology. I think the other avenue would be relating to her requirements of having a Psychiatry assessment. I would appreciate her family doctor's support in this as we currently do not have a psychiatric colleagues involved in our program. I have done some blood work just to assess for any atopic or components to her asthma going forward. We will see her through the St. Joe's Parkwood COVID rehabilitation program.
